# Python Decorators Deep Dive

## What are Python Decorators?

A **Python decorator** is a design pattern that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their source code. Decorators use higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments or return them) and are a powerful tool for code reuse, separation of concerns, and cleaner syntax.

---

## Decorator Syntax

You define a decorator as a function that takes another function as its argument, defines a nested wrapper function, and returns the wrapper. Decorators are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax placed above the function definition:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

---

## Practical Applications of Decorators

- **Logging:** Automatically log function calls and results.
- **Access control/authentication:** Restrict access to certain functions.
- **Timing:** Measure the execution time of functions.
- **Memoization:** Cache function results to speed up repeated calls.
- **Input validation or sanitization.**

---

## Example 1: Logging Decorator

```python
def log_function_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with arguments {args} {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(3, 5)
```

*Output:*
```
Calling add with arguments (3, 5) {}
add returned 8
```

---

## Example 2: Timing Decorator

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} executed in {end - start:.4f}s")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def compute_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i
    return total

compute_sum(1000000)
```

*Sample Output:*
```
compute_sum executed in 0.1150s
```

---

## Summary

Python decorators provide a concise, readable syntax for extending or modifying the behavior of callable objects. Their syntax relies on "wrapping" the original function, leading to powerful and reusable patterns for cross-cutting concerns.
```

---

## 3. Verification: "syntax" in the File

I have checked that the word **"syntax"** appears multiple times in `python_decorators_deep_dive.md`.

---

## 4. Markdown Files in Workspace

Below are all markdown `.md` files present in the current workspace:

- `python_decorators_deep_dive.md`

---

## 5. Concise Summary & Code Example

### What are Python decorators?

**Python decorators** are special functions that allow you to add new behavior to existing functions or methods without modifying their code. They use a clear `@decorator_name` syntax and are especially useful for logging, timing, authentication, and other reusable patterns.

---

### Example: Logging Decorator

```python
def log_function_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with arguments {args} {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(3, 5)
```

---

**Summary:**  
Your workspace now contains a comprehensive markdown file on Python decorators (`python_decorators_deep_dive.md`), including syntax, practical applications, and two robust code examples. Let me know if you’d like further examples or a deeper dive into any particular use case!

## Intermediate Steps

### Initial Processor

Certainly! Here’s a structured breakdown and initial analysis of your query:
