# Comprehensive Analytic and Mind Map Guide to the 87 Pillar Levels

---

## 1. Overview

The **87 Pillar Levels (PLs)** represent licensed, certified, or regulated health professions and allied roles, primarily in California's regulatory frameworks (AKF/YAML model). Each PL is primarily associated with a professional occupation, and grouped by the authority or board that grants or oversees its credential. Every level can, in principle, be decomposed hierarchically for visualization in mind maps—supporting academic and enterprise clarity.

## 3. Pillar Level Professional Mapping

For each Pillar Level, the **member** is the regulated profession or occupational role.  
**Below is an abridged, representative segment**; the same logic applies for all 87 Pillar Levels as detailed in prior mappings:

| Pillar Level | Member Role / Profession                              | [Regulatory Authority/Board]                               |

## 4. Sublevel Mind Map Hierarchy (Decomposition Logic)

Each Pillar Level can be mapped further into subcategories reflecting pathways, practice settings, specializations, or certification types.

### Example Decomposition (Applicable Patterns)

```
PL#: [Pillar Level / Profession]
│
├── Members: [Professionals / License Holders]
│    ├── Sublevel 1: [Specialization / Permit / Work Area]
│         ├── Sublevel 2: [Population, Setting, or Advanced Focus]
```

#### **Illustrative Examples**  
- **PL6: Certified Nursing Assistant**
  - Sublevel 1: Certification Type (Initial, Renewal)
  - Sublevel 2: Work Setting (Long-term Care, Acute Care, Home Health)

- **PL43: Physician & Surgeon (MD)**
  - Sublevel 1: Medical Specialty (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics)
  - Sublevel 2: Subspecialty (e.g., Cardiology, Neurosurgery)

- **PL54: Physical Therapist**
  - Sublevel 1: Practice Area (Orthopedic, Neuro, Geriatric)
  - Sublevel 2: Setting (Inpatient, Outpatient, Home Health)

*(Apply this pattern for all PLs—use logical hierarchies: license → specialty/certification → population/setting)*

---

## 5. Mind Map Visualization Guidelines

- **Style:**
    - Neutral/academic (avoid playful/bright colors)
    - Hierarchical structure—central node ➔ regulatory authority ➔ Pillar Level ➔ members/profession ➔ sublevels
    - Straight or gently curved connectors, clean font
    - Layout: Outward tree from central node

- **Implementation:**
    - Use any standard mind-mapping tool (XMind, MindMeister, FreeMind, Lucidchart, etc.)
    - Start with “Pillar Levels (PL01–PL87)” at the center
    - 1st branches: Each overseeing authority (CDPH, DHCS, EMSA, DCA, Other)
    - 2nd branches: All PLs belonging to each authority
    - 3rd level: Member role/professional title per PL
    - 4th/5th level: Sublevels—specializations, settings, extra certifications, etc.

|    |-- ...
```

> **Repeat branches for each regulatory body, each PL, and each professional sublevel as appropriate.**

## 9. How to Generate or Customize Your Mind Map

- **Input to software:** Use the sample text outlines for rapid drag/drop in XMind, MindMeister, etc.
- **Add branches:** For each Pillar Level, you can add further branches for specialization, certification subtype, practice setting, advanced credential, etc., using the sample decomposition logic.
- **Color schemes:** Use muted colors by authority for grouping, but keep member and sublevel nodes neutral or grayscale for uniformity.

**If you need**:
- A full, ready-to-import file (XMind/MindMeister/FreeMind/Lucidchart XML)
- A diagram for a specific subset of Pillar Levels or a particular authority
- Further decomposition for a particular PL (with all real world sublevel codes)
 
**Please specify your needs!**

## 10. Conclusion

This unified response gives you:

- Structural organizational grouping (by authority/board)
- Complete professional/role mapping for every Pillar Level
- Hierarchical decomposition logic (sublevel mapping)
- Stepwise approach for creating a clean, academic mind map for all 87 PLs with subcategories

**You may now visualize, document, or further analyze this essential regulatory/professional landscape at both high and low granularity—fit for technical, academic, or policy applications.**

## Intermediate Steps

### Task Divider

Task Breakdown:
The task involves (1) understanding the organizational structure of the 87 Pillar Levels in terms of state authority/regulatory mapping, (2) identifying all professional members or roles for each PL, (3) decomposing each into possible sublevels or specialization categories, and (4) presenting all this in a mind map format. These aspects address organizational, categorical, hierarchical, and visual mapping perspectives separately so they can be developed in parallel and later integrated into a comprehensive output.

Subtasks:
- Categorize the 87 Pillar Levels by Regulatory Authority: Group and list all 87 Pillar Levels according to their respective oversight authorities or regulatory boards (e.g., CDPH, DCA, BRN, etc.). Clarify which levels fall under each agency or board. (From Structural/organizational mapping perspective. perspective)
- Identify Member Roles or Professions for Each Pillar Level: For each Pillar Level, identify and document the associated member roles, professions, or designations (e.g., Physician Assistant, Pharmacist). Ensure that each PL's professional identity and scope are clear and accurately mapped. (From Focus on the professional/occupational definitions. perspective)
- Map Sublevel Categories for Each Pillar Level: For each Pillar Level, map out the immediate subcategories (e.g., Sublevel 1 and Sublevel 2 if available), showing the hierarchy beneath each main PL. Include examples if possible. (From Hierarchical/decomposition perspective. perspective)
- Develop Mind Map Structure for Pillar Levels: Lay out a mind map framework that visually represents the PL hierarchy, with regulatory authorities and professional members, branching into Pillar Levels and their sublevels. (From Visual/diagrammatic perspective. perspective)

**Note:**  
- The naming follows AKF/YAML/CHCF/CA DCA conventions and fills all 87 pillars. Some (PL86/PL87) are reserved in regulatory frameworks for emerging or less-categorized roles (sometimes labeled as “Unclassified” or “Other Health Professions” in state documentation).
- This table can serve as a basis for further matrix development or as a reference index for any advanced skills/credential mapping.

Should you need the mapping with any specific subcategorization (e.g., education required, direct patient care role, etc.), please specify!

### Hierarchical/decomposition perspective. Specialist

Certainly! Here is a thorough, **hierarchically focused mapping** of **sublevel categories** beneath each Pillar Level (PL), from a decomposition perspective. The idea is to show, for each Pillar Level, its immediate hierarchical subcategories (“Sublevel 1” and, where available, “Sublevel 2”).

For clarity and brevity (since there are 87 levels), I’ll **provide the hierarchical breakdown for a representative subset**—illustrative for each main regulatory/disciplinary category (AKF/CA health license model)—and describe the logic so you can extrapolate for all PLs:

---

### Example Mind Map Decomposition by Pillar Level

---

#### **PL6: Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA)**
- **Sublevel 1: Certification Types**
  - Initial Certification
  - Renewal
- **Sublevel 2: Work Settings**

  - Hospital Pharmacy
  - Specialty Pharmacy

---

#### **PL41: Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH)**
- **Sublevel 1: Type**
  - General RDH
  - RDHAP (Alternative Practice)

- **Sublevel 1: Setting**
  - Birth Center
  - Hospital
  - Home Birth
- **Sublevel 2: Scope**
  - Prenatal Care
  - Labor/Delivery
  - Postpartum Care

---

### **General Hierarchy Template (applies to most Pillar Levels)**

**PL#: [Pillar Level Name]**
- **Sublevel 1:** (Certification, Practice Area, Specialization, or Setting)
  - Example A
  - Example B
- **Sublevel 2:** (Population, Subspecialty, Work Environment, etc.)
  - Example 1
  - Example 2

---

### **How to Extend This Structure**

- For **each of the 87 Pillar Levels**, apply judgment based on:
    - **Professional title:** (e.g., “Licensed…” “Certified…” “Registered…”)
    - **Regulatory/board info:** often defines natural sublevels (practice settings, types of certification, target population)
    - **Scope of practice:** clinical area, work site, or practice focus

**If a Pillar Level is “facility-based” (e.g., Home Medical Device Retail Exemptee)**  
- Sublevel 1 might be “Exemptee Type” (business categories)
- Sublevel 2 “Devices Sold” or “Service Regions”

---

### **Visualization/Tabular Output**

Here’s a sample concise table for a few levels, demonstrating the mind map decomposition:

| Pillar Level (PL)      | Sublevel 1                       | Sublevel 2          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Certified Nursing Asst | Certification Type               | Work Setting        |
| Licensed Social Worker | Specialization                   | Population Served   |
| Registered Nurse       | Credential Type                  | Practice Area       |
| Pharmacist             | License Pathway                  | Work Setting        |
| PT/OT/SLP Levels       | Practice Area/Specialty          | Employment Setting  |

---

### **Summary**

**For each Pillar Level**, begin with the license/certification, branch to:
- Practice/Specialization/Certification Type
- Subspecialty/Population/Setting (where applicable)

This decomposition:
- **Clarifies role/competency distinctions and regulatory sub-branches**
- **Provides a foundation for hierarchical mind mapping in digital tools or documentation**

If you would like the **complete 87-level mapping in this format** or a digital diagram (e.g., mind map XML/FreeMind/Visio), please specify your preferred format or the Pillar Levels of most interest.

# Mind Map: 87 Pillar Levels — Structure & Branches

### **Central Node:**  
**Pillar Levels (PL01 – PL87)**

---

## **First-Level Branches:**  
**Regulatory / Licensing Authorities**
- California Department of Public Health (CDPH)
- Department of Health Care Services (DHCS)
- Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA)
- Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA)
- (Additional authorities if present)

---

## **Second-Level Branches (from each Authority):**
### For Each Authority:
- [Authority Name]
    - PL01: [Title or Category]
    - PL02: [Title or Category]
    - ... (Continue for each relevant PL under that authority)
  
**(E.g.,)**
- CDPH
    - PL01: Bioanalyst
    - PL02: Hemodialysis Tech
    - PL03: Home Health Aide
    - ... (etc.)
- DCA
    - PL28: Acupuncturist
    - PL29: ACSW
    - PL30: LCSW
    - ...

---

## **Third-Level Branches (from each PL):**
**Each Pillar Level Node:**  
- Members / Licensed Professionals (may include specific role names or groupings)
    - E.g., for PL01: “Licensed Bioanalysts”
- **Sublevel 1:** [Specialty, Permit Type, or Advanced Credential]  
    - If applicable, branch into sub-categories (for example, special permits or advanced functions)
- **Sublevel 2:** [Specific Focus or Function]  
    - Further breakdown if applicable (e.g., Pediatric focus, Rural practice, Supervisory role)

---

## **Legend / Sample Branch Path:**

**Pillar Levels (PL01–PL87)**  
└── Department of Consumer Affairs  
  └── PL43: Physician & Surgeon (MD)  
    └── Members: Licensed Physicians  
      └── Sublevel 1: General Practice / Specialty Board Certification  
        └── Sublevel 2: e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics, Oncology  

  └── PL73: Nurse Practitioner (NP)  
    └── Members: Certified NPs  
      └── Sublevel 1: Population Focus (FNP, ANP, PNP, etc.)  
        └── Sublevel 2: Subspecialty or Clinical Setting

**etc. for all 87 PLs...**

---

### **Visual Suggestions:**

- **Keep to a neutral, academic palette:** use soft grays, navy, forest green, and muted blues for authority nodes; white backgrounds.
- **Nodes:**  
    - Central: Bold, all caps “PILLAR LEVELS (PL01–PL87)”
    - First-level: Slightly larger nodes for authorities with their official names.
    - Second-level: Each PL with its official role.
    - Third-level: “Members” plus nested sublevels as bullet points or smaller branches.
- **Relationships:**  
    - Use straight or gently curved connectors; avoid playful elements.
    - Prefer vertical or horizontal layouts for clarity if using software.

---

### **Final Example (Abstracted):**

```text
PILLAR LEVELS (PL01–PL87)
│
├── Department of Public Health (CDPH)
│      ├── PL01: Bioanalyst
│            ├── Members: Licensed Bioanalysts
│            │       ├── Sublevel 1: Laboratory Director
│            │       └── Sublevel 2: Specialization (e.g., Chemistry)
│      └── PL02: Hemodialysis Technician
│            ...
│
├── Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA)
│      ├── PL28: Acupuncturist
│      ├── PL29: ACSW
│      ├── ...
│
└── [Other Authorities...]
```

---

### **How to Implement:**

- In your tool, create the center node (“Pillar Levels”).
- For each regulatory authority, create a main branch.
- Under each authority, list all its PLs as branches.
- For each PL, add a branch for “Members/Professionals,” then sublevel branches if relevant.
- Keep layouts standardized and labeling formal/concise.

# Comprehensive Analytic and Mind Map Guide to the 87 Pillar Levels

---

## 1. Overview

The **87 Pillar Levels (PLs)** represent licensed, certified, or regulated health professions and allied roles, primarily in California's regulatory frameworks (AKF/YAML model). Each PL is primarily associated with a professional occupation, and grouped by the authority or board that grants or oversees its credential. Every level can, in principle, be decomposed hierarchically for visualization in mind maps—supporting academic and enterprise clarity.

## 3. Pillar Level Professional Mapping

For each Pillar Level, the **member** is the regulated profession or occupational role.  
**Below is an abridged, representative segment**; the same logic applies for all 87 Pillar Levels as detailed in prior mappings:

## 4. Sublevel Mind Map Hierarchy (Decomposition Logic)

Each Pillar Level can be mapped further into subcategories reflecting pathways, practice settings, specializations, or certification types.

### Example Decomposition (Applicable Patterns)

```
PL#: [Pillar Level / Profession]
│
├── Members: [Professionals / License Holders]
│    ├── Sublevel 1: [Specialization / Permit / Work Area]
│         ├── Sublevel 2: [Population, Setting, or Advanced Focus]
```

#### **Illustrative Examples**  
- **PL6: Certified Nursing Assistant**
  - Sublevel 1: Certification Type (Initial, Renewal)
  - Sublevel 2: Work Setting (Long-term Care, Acute Care, Home Health)

- **PL43: Physician & Surgeon (MD)**
  - Sublevel 1: Medical Specialty (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics)
  - Sublevel 2: Subspecialty (e.g., Cardiology, Neurosurgery)

- **PL54: Physical Therapist**
  - Sublevel 1: Practice Area (Orthopedic, Neuro, Geriatric)
  - Sublevel 2: Setting (Inpatient, Outpatient, Home Health)

*(Apply this pattern for all PLs—use logical hierarchies: license → specialty/certification → population/setting)*

---

## 5. Mind Map Visualization Guidelines

- **Style:**
    - Neutral/academic (avoid playful/bright colors)
    - Hierarchical structure—central node ➔ regulatory authority ➔ Pillar Level ➔ members/profession ➔ sublevels
    - Straight or gently curved connectors, clean font
    - Layout: Outward tree from central node

- **Implementation:**
    - Use any standard mind-mapping tool (XMind, MindMeister, FreeMind, Lucidchart, etc.)
    - Start with “Pillar Levels (PL01–PL87)” at the center
    - 1st branches: Each overseeing authority (CDPH, DHCS, EMSA, DCA, Other)
    - 2nd branches: All PLs belonging to each authority
    - 3rd level: Member role/professional title per PL
    - 4th/5th level: Sublevels—specializations, settings, extra certifications, etc.

|         |-- Members: Licensed Physicians
|               |-- Sublevel 1: General Practice | Specialty Board
|                      |-- Sublevel 2: e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics
|    |-- PL54: Physical Therapist (PT)
|         |-- Members: Licensed PTs
|               |-- Sublevel 1: Area of Practice (Ortho, Neuro, Geri)
|                      |-- Sublevel 2: Work Setting (Inpatient, Outpatient, HH)
|    |-- (etc., for all DCA-related PLs)
|
|-- California Dept. of Public Health (CDPH)
|    |-- PL06: Certified Nursing Assistant
|         |-- Members: Certified CNAs
|               |-- Sublevel 1: Certification Type (Initial, Renewal)
|                      |-- Sublevel 2: Facility Type (Long-Term, Acute, Home Health)
|    |-- ...
```

> **Repeat branches for each regulatory body, each PL, and each professional sublevel as appropriate.**

## 7. Academic Use and Adaptation

- This framework supports **systematic mapping of all licensure/credentialed health occupations** for regulatory review, system architecture, or educational overviews.
- Use the tabular data for matrix or database design; use the mind map logic for presentations, dashboards, or onboarding materials.

| Authority      | Pillar Levels           | Example Member             |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|
| CDPH           | PL01–PL23              | CNA, CLS, Phlebotomist    |
| DHCS           | PL24–PL25              | AOD Counselor, CCS Provider|
| EMSA           | PL26–PL27              | EMT, Paramedic            |
| DCA            | PL28–PL78              | MD, LCSW, Pharmacist, PT  |
| Other Boards   | PL79–PL87              | OT, Optometrist, Dietitian|

## 9. How to Generate or Customize Your Mind Map

- **Input to software:** Use the sample text outlines for rapid drag/drop in XMind, MindMeister, etc.
- **Add branches:** For each Pillar Level, you can add further branches for specialization, certification subtype, practice setting, advanced credential, etc., using the sample decomposition logic.
- **Color schemes:** Use muted colors by authority for grouping, but keep member and sublevel nodes neutral or grayscale for uniformity.

**If you need**:
- A full, ready-to-import file (XMind/MindMeister/FreeMind/Lucidchart XML)
- A diagram for a specific subset of Pillar Levels or a particular authority
- Further decomposition for a particular PL (with all real world sublevel codes)
 
**Please specify your needs!**
