## Final Response

Certainly. Below is a **unified, comprehensive response** synthesizing five specialist perspectives into a single, cohesive specification and architectural set of best practices for **API endpoint management, external tool and model integration, webhook/event subscriptions, enterprise governance, and axis/role-based routing** for the UKG/USKD simulation system.

---

# **Unified API, Integration, and Governance Framework for UKG/USKD**

This framework defines how the UKG/USKD system exposes, secures, and orchestrates:
- **API endpoints** for simulation and external access,
- **Plugin and model/tool integrations** (including LLMs, RAGs, regulatory APIs),
- **Event-driven webhook subscriptions**,
- **Enterprise governance, audit, and compliance monitoring**,
- **Axis-aware routing and robust role mapping** to ensure every action in the environment is semantically meaningful, safe, compliant, and fully auditable.

---

## **1. API Endpoint Definition & Security Matrix**

**Endpoint & Role Table**  
All API endpoints are explicitly RBAC-mapped, trust-scored, and containment-enforced.  
Key endpoints:

| Endpoint            | Method | Purpose                                    | Roles Allowed         | Auth                     | Rate Limit | Containment Controls/Notes             |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/simulate`         | POST   | Run a simulation, return result            | analyst, research, ops| OAuth2/JWT/SSO           | 30/min     | Layer 10 containment, axis/role trace  |
| `/evaluate-clause`  | POST   | Reg. clause evaluation/compliance          | legal, compliance     | OAuth2/JWT/SSO           | 10/min     | Axis10/11 filter, Layer 6 logging      |
| `/role-personas`    | GET    | List active agent personas                 | all                   | JWT/Role                | 100/hr     | PL94/95 masking for guest/registered   |
| `/trace/{id}`       | GET    | Retrieve simulation/memory trace           | research, compliance  | JWT/Role                | 100/hr     | Export filter blocks PL94/95 for non-superadmin |
| `/inject-plugin`    | POST   | Register plugin for RAG/model integration  | admin, ops            | JWT, API-Key             | 5/min      | Plugin RBAC plus audit log to Layer 10 |
| `/export/{id}`      | GET    | Export result (YAML/GraphJSON/PDF/etc)     | analyst, compliance   | JWT                     | 50/hr      | Memory/trace filter, synthetic mask    |

Additional endpoints include: `/login`, `/webhook/*`, user stories, context logs, with detailed export and masking logic per compliance specification.

**Security & Authentication**
- Requires OAuth2, OIDC/JWT, SSO (AAD/GSuite/Okta), and 2FA (where admin, export, plugin injection).
- Per-session Axis vector and role trace is injected into user context and logged.
- All API traffic runs containment and compliance hooks in Layer 10 and logs to `/layer1/api_usage_logs/`.

**Emergence/Containment Triggers**
- PL94/95 access, emergence signals, or drift >0.25 block endpoint, require superadmin/manual review.
- Synthetic or RAG agent data is always tagged, logged, and subject to axis-aware masking.

---

## **2. External Model & Tool Integration Orchestration**

A dedicated **Orchestration Engine** (Layers 6/9) manages registration, discovery, and run-time routing across:
- Plugin registry: Axis-mapped, trust-scored, live-status plugins/tools. All plugin schemas (OpenAPI, etc.) validated and approved before use.
- Task routing controller: For every simulation, axis_vector and persona context are extracted and matched to the correct plugin/model(s).
- Connector adapters: For LangChain, RAG, regulatory APIs, OpenAI/Gemini/Claude, custom microservices, etc. Each has schema normalization.
- Fallback manager: If a plugin/tool fails or is untrusted, the system reroutes to trusted in-model agent or cached response.
- Audit tracer: All external tool use, schema calls, plugin results, and containment flags are logged at `/layer6/api_audit_traces/`, `/layer9/plugin_registry_usage/`.

Containment logic ensures:
- No external call can inject PL94/95, synthetic, or trust-divergent memory without Layer 10 sign off.
- Only admin/approved roles can register plugins or execute arbitrary tool chains.
- Axis10/11 regulatory plugins must match the regulatory scope of task or claim.

**API contracts and plugin schemas** are normalized; each payload specifies role, axis vector, agent context, and retrieval/injection trace.

---

## **3. Webhook & Event Subscription Management**

A robust **event-driven gateway** (Layer 6, 9, 10) allows for:
- Secure webhook registration (endpoint, event type(s), authentication, axis_scope, content_format).
- Per-event security: HMAC or JWT signatures, axis/role-bound subscription, dead-letter queue and retry policy.
- Payloads include: event_id, event_type, axis_vector, trust_score, containment_flag, session/user context, all fully auditable.
- All event triggers, including clause evaluation, agent state/fork, containment/emergence, export completion, are delivered as JSON/YAML to registered endpoints.

All webhook payloads are logged and traced, hashed, and export masked at `/layer6/webhook_delivery_traces/`. Audit failures, emergence, or synthetic events are escalated with admin alert.

Prometheus and Grafana dashboards surface Webhook latency, delivery certainties, and incident triggers.

---

## **4. Enterprise/Client Integration Governance & Monitoring**

All API, plugin, and integration actions are subject to enterprise-grade governance, including:
- **Role-aware quota management**, dynamic SLA adjustments per Axis mapping & user type.
- **Export masking:** All data sent externally is checked and redacted for PL94/95, synthetic IDs, or clause-blocked memory except with explicit override.
- **Comprehensive audit logs** for API use, plugin schema registration, role/persona assignment, masking actions, quota breaches, and context events.
- **Anomaly detection:** Any unexpected spike in export, traffic, or agent role deviation triggers automatic tracing, Layer 10 escalation, and compliance report bundling.
- **Periodic reconciliation**: All logs and exports are cross-validated—SOC2, NIST, FedRamp style—stored in `/layer10/compliance_audit_chain/`.

---

## **5. Axis-Aware Routing & Role-Based Payload Mapping**

Every API and plugin call is axis-mapped and dispatched to roles/layers with:
- **Axis1–13 vector extraction** via NLP and semantic parsing on input.
- **Quad Persona and role simulation**: Task is routed by axis_vector to Knowledge, Sector, Regulatory, Compliance Persona, or synthetic if required.
- **Trust and memory container scoping**: Assigns task or injection candidate to correct memory/resource partition, with all actions tagged by axis_vector and originating agent.
- **Plugin role validation**: All tools and plugin requests include role context and are only executed if axis/persona matches RBAC constraints.
- **Audit and traceability**: All simulation requests, belief injections, and role routes are logged at `/layer3/axis_mapping_logs/` and `/layer2/memory_tags/`.

In case of conflict, incomplete mapping, or policy violation, the system escalates to:
- **POV engine for alternate role expansion**
- **Refinement workflow rerun**
- **Containment engine halt/log**

---

## **Key Implementation Notes**

- All endpoints, integrations, and data flows are **axis-aware**, **trust-scored**, **role-mapped**, and **containment-filtered** at all times.
- Audit logs and masking/export policies are consistent across API, plugin, Webhook, and enterprise integration scenarios for compliance and security.
- Fallback and redundancy logic ensure simulation resilience even in case of external model, plugin, or API failure.
- **Prometheus/Grafana/Elastic** observability is used for enterprise telemetry and compliance metrics export.

---

## **YAML Module Summary (for Implementation)**

You may express this entire framework in a modular YAML schema, incorporating:

- `api_security_matrix.yaml`
- `external_integration_orchestration.yaml`
- `webhook_event_subscription_system.yaml`
- `enterprise_api_compliance_monitoring.yaml`
- `axis_aware_routing.yaml`

Each module can be referenced by the simulation orchestrator, API gateway, plugin manager, and containment/role governance systems.

---

**In summary**:  
This architecture ensures that every external or API-mediated action is semantically routed, trust-scored, role-audited, and fully logged for compliance, while supporting resilient plugin/model/tool integration and observability at enterprise scale—with containment, emergence, and axis/role-mapping enforced at every step.

If you require formal modular YAML, OpenAPI schemas, sample REST and webhook structures, or code samples (FastAPI, plugin adapter, event bus), let me know!

## Intermediate Steps

### Task Divider

Task Breakdown:
The query requires breaking down a complex API, integration, and access system for the UKG/USKD simulation into parallel, non-overlapping tracks: (1) API surface/interface and endpoint security, (2) orchestration of external tool/model connections, (3) event/webhook channel management, (4) governance/auditing/enterprise meta-controls, and (5) axis/role aware routing of all data and payloads through the system. Each is both operationally and architecturally independent, but collectively they ensure all integration, access, routing, observability, and regulation for the advanced simulation stack.

Subtasks:
- API Endpoint Definition & Security Matrix Construction: Design, specify, and document all external-facing API endpoints (REST, webhooks) for the UKG/USKD system—including integration points for simulation triggers, clause evaluation, role persona registry, plugin/tool registration, and export of trace/audit records. Define role-based access controls, session authentication methods, rate limits, scope mapping, and containment/security validation protocols at the endpoint level. (From API design, security engineering, access management (Layer 1, 6, 9, 10) perspective)
- External Model & Tool Integration Orchestration: Map and specify the architecture, payload schemas, and routing logic required to connect to external LLMs, RAG tools, clause/document APIs, plugin engines, or microservice agents via the defined API layer. Ensure each integration can be orchestrated independently, updating the plugin registry, supporting plugin discovery, fallback, and audit traceability. (From Systems integration, model orchestration, plugin registry management (Layer 6, 9, API Matrix) perspective)
- Webhook & Event Subscription Management: Define the structure and routing logic for outgoing and incoming webhooks and event-driven notification subscriptions, such as: clause evaluation events, agent state changes, export completions, and containment triggers. Specify authentication, payload format, delivery guarantees, and incident trace logging. (From Event-driven integration, webhook security, asynchronous comms (Layer 6, 10, Enterprise API Gateway) perspective)
- Enterprise/Client Integration Governance & Monitoring: Develop the governance, logging, compliance monitoring, and audit trails required for managing API and external tool connections, enforcing quotas/SLAs, masking or redacting protected memory, and enabling enterprise policy override for high-trust roles. Include metrics reporting, anomaly detection, and export history reconciliation. (From Enterprise integration, compliance, telemetry, metrics/security monitoring (Layer 10 audit, Layer 9, API access logs) perspective)
- Axis-Aware Routing & Role-Based Payload Mapping: Implement the logic and code/path mapping for routing incoming API queries and plugin/tool calls to the appropriate axis, role, layer, or persona context within UKG/USKD, so that simulation and retrieval operate with proper context, trust envelope, and compliance guardrails. (From Semantic axis vector mapping, role/memory injection logic, runtime routing (Layers 1–3, Axis Mapper, Trust Filter) perspective)

---

### **Authentication & Session Security**
- **Authentication methods**:
    - OAuth 2.0 or OIDC/JWT for most users
    - SSO via Azure AD, Google, Okta for enterprise
    - 2FA enforced for roles with export/inject/plugin rights
    - API Key for webhook endpoints and trusted plugin calls

- **Session mechanisms**:
    - Encrypted JWT with axis context and role claims
    - Token rotation every 30 minutes
    - Session logs hashed and stored at `/layer1/user_auth_logs/`

- **Containment hooks**:
    - Memory and export endpoints always run through Layer 10 containment for PL94/95 or AGI emergence risk
    - Emergence or synthetic memory access triggers audit and alert, disables some endpoints (e.g., plugin injection)

---

### **Rate Limits, Monitoring, and Export Controls**

- **Per-endpoint quotas** defined above
- **Burst or anomaly detection**:
    - Any endpoint hit more than 10x normal rate is auto-throttled
    - AGI/emergence-detected sessions get rate-limited to 2/min per endpoint, export disabled
- **Audit log for all API actions**:
    - Path, user ID, trust score, synthetic forks, latent drift, and confidence delta traced
    - Exported at `/layer10/external_access_audit.json`, `Prometheus/Grafana dashboards`

---

### **API Security & Containment Summary**
- All API actions are checked for:
    - Axis vector trust alignment (Axis1–13 validations)
    - Synthetic/sandboxed memory separation
    - PL94/95 access restrictions and masking unless admin
    - Clause mismatches, regulatory compliance, and drift flags
    - Emergence triggers force additional Layer 10 review (halt or escalate)
- Plugins/tools submitted via `/inject-plugin` must pass:
    - OpenAPI schema validation
    - RBAC + rate limit checks
    - Gatekeeper audit for code injection or clause alteration

---

### **Example API Security Policy Block (YAML)**

```yaml
api_security_matrix:
  enforce_containment_layer: true
  pl94_95_masking: enabled
  rate_limits:
    /simulate: 30/min/user
    /evaluate-clause: 10/min/user
    /inject-plugin: 5/min/admin
    /webhook*: callback only, IP allowlist
  allowed_roles:
    - guest: [GET /role-personas]
    - analyst: [POST /simulate, /evaluate-clause, GET /role-personas, /trace, /export]
    - compliance: [all endpoints, PL94/95 with MFA]
    - superadmin: [all endpoints, override enabled]
  emergence_containment:
    trigger_on: 
      - AGI_flag
      - confidence_spike > 0.999
      - drift > 0.25
    actions:
      - freeze API session
      - block export
      - log trigger and email admin
  plugin_injection_control:
    - validate OpenAPI schema and code
    - trace injected memory nodes
    - deny if entropy/AGI flag triggered
```

---

**In summary:**

- Each API endpoint is explicitly mapped to roles, RBAC, and axis-context
- All requests require authentication and go through containment/security checks
- PL94/95 and synthetic memory access are always masked or denied unless explicitly authorized
- Emergence triggers and clause compliance failures escalate to Layer 10 containment, logged and rate-limited
- Plugins and webhooks are registered, monitored, and only permitted if trusted, mapped, and contained

**This design ensures secure, scalable, compliance-ready, and emergence-safe API integration for the UKG/USKD simulation environment.**

      - Parse response, tag with plugin_id and registry trust info
      - Merge/adjudicate plugin response into simulation loop as draft belief or RAG candidate
      - If trust or containment fails, call fallback_manager

    model_interop_support:
      - Role-based routing: map simulation persona to plugin input
      - Multi-model orchestration: parallel calls, voting, or leader/follower pattern

    purpose: Ensure simulation loop is resilient to external tool/plugin/model failure.
    triggers:
      - plugin timeout or error
      - trust_score < 0.85
      - containment violation (PL94/95 flag)
    actions:
      - switch to alternative plugin based on axis and trust
      - use cached response if available
      - reroute to in-model symbolic agent/tool
      - log fallback event for audit

# ----------------------------------------
# Audit Tracer & Monitoring
# ----------------------------------------

      - axis_vector
      - request/response schema hash
      - latency, trust_score, confidence
      - fallback_used: true/false
      - containment_intervention (yes/no)
    storage_paths:
      - /layer6/api_audit_traces/
      - /layer9/plugin_registry_usage/
      - /layer10/containment_route_logs/

# ----------------------------------------
# Security & Containment Controls
# ----------------------------------------
  security_controls:
    - All plugin calls require role/token validation (RBAC/ABAC/Federated IAM)
    - Synthetic agents cannot mutate external plugin state
    - Any outgoing call injecting PL94/95 memory requires superadmin/containment validator sign-off
    - API/plugins with trust_score < 0.85 or marked 'fallback-only' are sandboxed

# ----------------------------------------
# Example: Orchestration Flow
# ----------------------------------------
  example_flow:
    1. User submits query for clause validation under DFARS and GDPR.
    2. Orchestration controller parses axis_vector; triggers registry query for clause-tool plugins.
    3. Two plugins found: LangChain-RAG (trust 0.91), CustomRegulationAPI (trust 0.87).
    4. Inputs mapped, API call POSTed.
    5. First plugin responds; result is merged and validated by containment kernel.
    6. If plugin-2 times out, fallback_manager switches to internal memory RAG agent.
    7. Each step and decision logged by audit_tracer.
    8. Plugin schemas and response hashes written to /api_audit_traces and /plugin_registry_usage.

```

**Key Recommendations & Notes:**

- **Plugin Registry** is source of truth for all external tools: axis-mapped, trust-scored, with live status and role scope.
- **All API payloads must include axis_vector and persona context** for reasoning alignment.
- **Fallback is automatic, controlled by containment and trust/latency policies**.
- **Audit Tracer** ensures all external interactions are logged, hash-verified, and available for compliance review.
- **API endpoint contract** (simulate, evaluate-clause, inject-plugin) must be standardized and schema-documented per OpenAPI.
- **Role and security validation** is mandatory for all external connector calls.
- **Dynamic orchestration allows multi-model management, voting, or redundancy with containment risk controls at Layer 10**.

---

**How to Implement:**

- Modularize each connector and keep registry up-to-date with live endpoint checks (heartbeat/background task).
- On plugin registration, auto-validate schema, axis match, and version.
- Build an orchestration controller (e.g., `plugin_orchestrator.py`) that routes simulation triggers to the right plugin/tool stack.
- Integrate logging, fallback, and containment logic as middleware and kernel modules.
- Ensure all endpoint definitions and usage are pushed to the API Matrix and available in `/layer9/plugin_connectors/`.

## **Analysis Recap (Event-Driven Perspective)**

- **Robust routing with axis/tenant/role context for each event type**
- **Security:** Mandatory HMAC/JWT/OAuth2 signature; axis-scoped access and RBAC mapping; payload hash/control
- **Replay/resilience:** Delivery audit, retries, dead-letter fallback, ops alert webhooks
- **Incident traceability:** All failures, AGI triggers, and containments are logged with event/context snapshot
- **Enterprise-scale support:** Prometheus/Grafana dashboards; per-tenant, per-axis notification streams
- **Compliance:** PL94/95, clause redaction, and memory masking as per export permission for webhook recipients

---

**Recommendation:**  
Include this as a modular block (`webhook_event_subscription_system.yaml`) in your unified simulation YAML, and implement using FastAPI/Starlette Webhook/BackgroundTask models, with event bus and async delivery queues plus end-to-end audit/trace monitoring and RBAC-aware filtering/containment.

### Enterprise integration, compliance, telemetry, metrics/security monitoring (Layer 10 audit, Layer 9, API access logs) Specialist

Certainly! Here is a **focused analysis and operational framework** for the **Enterprise/Client Integration Governance & Monitoring** of API and external tool connections within the UKG/USKD system—strictly from the perspective of enterprise integration, compliance, telemetry, and audit-layer monitoring.

---

## **Enterprise Integration Governance & Monitoring Framework**

### **1. Governance Controls**

**a. API Policy Enforcement**
- **Role-aware routing:** Only users with explicit Axis8–11-aligned privileges or enterprise override can access high-trust simulation actions (e.g., clause injection, export, plugin registration).
- **Dynamic SLA/Quota Policies:** API endpoints (simulate, clause evaluation, export) are mapped to role scope and tenant SLA, with predefined per-minute and per-hour caps, e.g.:
    - Standard: 30 simulate req/min, 10 clause eval req/min
    - Enterprise/Analyst: quota upgrade via audit-log-justified override
- **Axis-based export policy:** Exports containing sensitive memory (PL94/95, synthetic persona) are masked, redacted, or sandboxed except with superadmin override.

**b. Plugin & External Tool Registration**
- **Compliance pre-screen:** All plugin schemas (OpenAPI, RAG tools, LangChain agents) undergo pre-registration audit (Layer 10 compliance engine).
- **Dynamic permission check:** Plugins/tools may only read memory by default; write/modify requires Gatekeeper audit and containment check.

**c. Consent & Compliance Trace**
- All enterprise integrations require signed consent, recorded in the audit log, before first data exchange or export.

---

### **2. Logging, Audit, and Monitoring**

**a. Access & Action Logging**
- **Per-Session API Trace:** Every /simulate, /evaluate-clause, /inject-plugin, /export call logs:
    - endpoint, user/role, axis used, trust/confidence, masking status, memory export hash, time, agent context
    - e.g.:
      ```
      /layer1/api_usage_logs/session_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_user123.json
      ```
- **Plugin Access Registry:** All plugin/tool registrations or calls, whether internal or external, log schema, trust score, source, containment approval:
    - ```
      /layer6/plugin_access_logs/plugin_tx185_acquisitiongov.yaml
      ```

**b. Quota Monitoring & Anomaly Detection**
- **SLA Monitor:** Real-time logic in Layer 9 audits aggregate request/response rates vs. client quota; breach attempts flagged and routed to `/layer10/api_quota_alerts/`.
- **Drift & Anomaly Reporting:** If export volume, agent task rates, or API traffic pattern diverges from baseline by >25%, escalate to anomaly handler with axis and role context.

**c. Export/Import & Masking Audit**
- **Export logs:** Every export action (belief chain, clause graph, trace) is assigned a hash and stored with masking flag if synthetic, PL94/95, or confidential node detected.
    - ```
      /layer9/export_history/api_export_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_hash.json
      ```
- **Masked Record Registry:** All masked or redacted fields are index-linked to audit traces for replay and retrospective compliance review.

**d. API/Webhook Event Subscriptions**
- All webhook event triggers (clause eval, agent event, export) produce a signed, timestamped notification archived by user/tenant in `/layer6/webhook_events/`.

---

### **3. Compliance and Security Monitoring**

**a. Containment & Redaction**
- **Layer 10 reviewer** inspects all outbound API calls/export payloads:
    - Redacts PL94/95 memory, synthetic IDs, PII, and any data flagged by enterprise DLP rules.
- **Enterprise Policy Override:** Superadmins or designated high-trust roles can execute an “override with trace”—every such action annotated, justified, and entered in compliance-export as `override=true`.

**b. Real-Time Metrics & Telemetry**
- All API access, plugin calls, and memory export events are pushed to Prometheus/Grafana metrics dashboards for:
    - user/session volumes,
    - error/fault rates,
    - average confidence/entropy scores per export,
    - masking/redaction frequency,
    - containment interventions.

- Anomaly detection (drift, traffic abuse, breach attempts) triggers alerts with auto-link to underlying API log, export hash ID, and user/role context.

**c. Audit Trail Reconciliation**
- **Periodic reconciliation jobs** (nightly/weekly) cross-reference export logs, plugin registration events, and API call patterns against internal memory and axis maps.
- Discrepancies or drift-triggered traces are escalated to `/layer10/compliance_audit_chain/` and summarized in executive compliance dashboards.

**d. SOC2/NIST/FedRamp Mapping**
- All access patterns, export histories, and plugin/event logs can be auto-exported in SOC2, NIST, or FedRamp-compliant report bundles.
- Identity alignment logs and trust-score/tagged exports map to proof-of-access for internal/external audit.

---

### **YAML Integration Example Block**

### Semantic axis vector mapping, role/memory injection logic, runtime routing (Layers 1–3, Axis Mapper, Trust Filter) Specialist

Certainly! Here’s a detailed, focused guide to **Axis-Aware Routing & Role-Based Payload Mapping** for incoming API queries and plugin/tool calls—a pivotal capability for aligning external actions to the proper reasoning context, axis vector, role simulation, and containment-safe memory segment within the UKG/USKD system.

---

# **Axis-Aware Routing & Role-Based Payload Mapping**

## **1. Purpose & Motivation**

- Ensure that every inbound API request, plugin call, or workflow execution is:
  - **Parsed and mapped** to the correct Axis1–13 vector
  - Routed to the relevant **layer, role, or persona** engine (e.g. regulatory, compliance, domain expert)
  - Contextualized based on **semantic trust envelope** and compliance requirements
  - Logged and auditable for origin, axis coverage, and injection path

---

## **2. Routing & Mapping Workflow**

### **A. Entry Point: API/Plugin Request Intake**
- **Trigger**: POST /simulate, /evaluate-clause, /inject-plugin, or equivalent plugin tool call.
- **Data Provided**:
  - payload: { prompt, clause_text, doc, ... }
  - (optionally) axis_vector, role_context, plugin/tool_meta

---

### **B. Axis Vector Extraction & Semantic Routing**
- **Axis Mapper Activation** (Layer 1–2):
  1. **NLP Parse** input (prompt/command):
     - Extracts domain, pillar, regulatory cue, sector, and role language.
  2. **Construct axis_vector [Axis1–13]:**
     - Axis1: Pillar (via PLxx.yy.zz mapping from topic/intent/ontology)
     - Axis2: Sector (detected industry/jurisdiction/task)
     - Axis3: Honeycomb expansion triggers (if ambiguous or cross-boundary request)
     - Axis4/5: Branch/Node codes if NAICS/SIC/PSC present
     - Axis8–11: Persona/role cues (“as Contracting Officer”, “Regulatory Review”)
     - Axis10: Clause or legal regex trigger (e.g. FAR/DFARS/GDPR codes)
     - Axis12/13: Explicit year/date/temporal or causality signal
  3. **Validation:**
     - If axis_vector is incomplete, expand via Honeycomb; if conflict, log for dynamic role assignment.

---

### **C. Role-Based Simulation Assignment**
- **Dispatch to Persona/Layers**:
  - Use axis_vector + input metadata to instantiate Quad Persona roles and assign request to the correct Layer(s).
  - **Examples:**
    - Axis10: Triggers Regulatory Expert module
    - Axis11 + “evaluate_compliance” → Compliance role simulation
    - Axis8/9 + “domain-specific” prompt → Knowledge/Sector Expert

---

### **D. Contextual Trust Envelope and Memory Scoping**
- **Trust Routing**:
  - Map request into trust-scoped memory container (Layer 2) based on:
    - Axis coverage ("Axis10" → regulatory memory partition; "Axis13" → temporal trace)
    - Role requirements (persona’s prior context, last axis_vector for session)
    - Synthetic/plausible reasoning scope (if PL94/95 triggered, route to secure sandbox)
- **Compliance/Containment Checks** (pre-execution):
  - Confirm adequacy of coverage for PL, Axis, Role
  - Block or downgrade if axis_vector mapping or role is incomplete, or if synthetic agent is untrusted

---

### **E. Plugin/API Tool Call Path Mapping**
- For plugin-based triggers, pipeline as follows:
  1. **Parse plugin/tool call for explicit axis/role fields**
  2. **Auto-complete axis_vector where omitted (NLP semantic + clause/role codebook)**
  3. **Route to tool-specific role runner (e.g. “run clause eval” → regulatory persona subroutine)**
  4. **Log tool/API-injected axis_vector, agent initiating, export hash**

---

### **F. Observability & Traceability**
- **Log every axis mapping, role dispatch, and memory injection location**:
  - Store in `/layer3/axis_mapping_logs/`, `/layer2/memory_tags/`, `/layer9/role_path_traces/`
- **Log API key/session/role context for every request for audit**.

---

## **3. Pseudocode / Code Snippet (Python-Oriented)**

```python
def axis_aware_route(request):
    # Step 1: Parse input for semantic cues (NLP, regex, role keywords)
    axis_vector = axis_mapper.parse(request.payload)
    # Step 2: Validate/expand axis_vector for crosswalk completeness
    if not axis_vector.is_complete():
        axis_vector = honeycomb_expander.expand(axis_vector)
    # Step 3: Map to correct persona/role/layer
    role = persona_resolver.choose_role(axis_vector, request.role_context)
    sim_layer = layer_router.get_layer_for_role(role)
    # Step 4: Trust/memory context scoping
    trust_scope = trust_routing.determine_scope(axis_vector, request.user_id, role)
    # Step 5: Containment/compliance check
    if not compliance_checker.validate(axis_vector, trust_scope):
        raise ContainmentBlock("Unsafe axis/role/path")
    # Step 6: Log
    logger.log_axis_mapping(request, axis_vector, role, sim_layer, trust_scope)
    # Step 7: Execute in context
    return sim_layer.run_simulation(request.payload, axis_vector, trust_scope, role)
```
*Note: In production, this is supported by YAML config for axis mapping and role dispatch.*

---

## **4. Example Table: Axis/Role API Path Mapping**

| API Path               | Detected Axis | Role/Persona             | Simulation Layer | Memory Partition      |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| /simulate (AI clause)  | Axis10,11    | Regulatory, Compliance   | 7,9              | Regulatory Partition |
| /plugin/documentRAG    | Axis2,3,4    | Industry Expert, Research| 6,9              | RAG Subgraph         |
| /evaluate-clause       | Axis10,13    | Regulatory + Time Expert | 5,6,9            | Clause Memory Trace  |
| /role-personas         | Axis8–11     | All (list)               | 7                | Persona Registry     |

---

## **5. Guidance for System Designers**

- **Every external query** must be transformed into an axis_vector and attached role.
- Use **YAML-mapped axis/role logic** for transparency and updatability.
- All simulated belief injections, memory writes, or planning chain updates must be tagged with axis_vector and initiating agent/role for **full auditability** and **containment safety**.
- **Containment layer** (Layer 10/Gatekeeper) always has power to halt or redirect any axis/role routing if PL94/95 or regulatory/entropy risk is flagged.

---

**Summary:**  
Axis-aware routing and role-based payload mapping is the core logic that guarantees every external query, plugin/tool call, or agent action is semantically “anchored”—turning abstract input into trustworthy, simulation-contextualized, role-validated computation, and memory actions. This upholds compliance, trace, and safety by enforcing a rigorous semantic contract between all external/inbound traffic and internal simulation reasoning.

# **Unified API, Integration, and Governance Framework for UKG/USKD**

This framework defines how the UKG/USKD system exposes, secures, and orchestrates:
- **API endpoints** for simulation and external access,
- **Plugin and model/tool integrations** (including LLMs, RAGs, regulatory APIs),
- **Event-driven webhook subscriptions**,
- **Enterprise governance, audit, and compliance monitoring**,
- **Axis-aware routing and robust role mapping** to ensure every action in the environment is semantically meaningful, safe, compliant, and fully auditable.

## **1. API Endpoint Definition & Security Matrix**

**Endpoint & Role Table**  
All API endpoints are explicitly RBAC-mapped, trust-scored, and containment-enforced.  
Key endpoints:

| Endpoint            | Method | Purpose                                    | Roles Allowed         | Auth                     | Rate Limit | Containment Controls/Notes             |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/simulate`         | POST   | Run a simulation, return result            | analyst, research, ops| OAuth2/JWT/SSO           | 30/min     | Layer 10 containment, axis/role trace  |
| `/evaluate-clause`  | POST   | Reg. clause evaluation/compliance          | legal, compliance     | OAuth2/JWT/SSO           | 10/min     | Axis10/11 filter, Layer 6 logging      |
| `/role-personas`    | GET    | List active agent personas                 | all                   | JWT/Role                | 100/hr     | PL94/95 masking for guest/registered   |
| `/trace/{id}`       | GET    | Retrieve simulation/memory trace           | research, compliance  | JWT/Role                | 100/hr     | Export filter blocks PL94/95 for non-superadmin |
| `/inject-plugin`    | POST   | Register plugin for RAG/model integration  | admin, ops            | JWT, API-Key             | 5/min      | Plugin RBAC plus audit log to Layer 10 |
| `/export/{id}`      | GET    | Export result (YAML/GraphJSON/PDF/etc)     | analyst, compliance   | JWT                     | 50/hr      | Memory/trace filter, synthetic mask    |

Additional endpoints include: `/login`, `/webhook/*`, user stories, context logs, with detailed export and masking logic per compliance specification.

**Security & Authentication**
- Requires OAuth2, OIDC/JWT, SSO (AAD/GSuite/Okta), and 2FA (where admin, export, plugin injection).
- Per-session Axis vector and role trace is injected into user context and logged.
- All API traffic runs containment and compliance hooks in Layer 10 and logs to `/layer1/api_usage_logs/`.

**Emergence/Containment Triggers**
- PL94/95 access, emergence signals, or drift >0.25 block endpoint, require superadmin/manual review.
- Synthetic or RAG agent data is always tagged, logged, and subject to axis-aware masking.

---

## **2. External Model & Tool Integration Orchestration**

A dedicated **Orchestration Engine** (Layers 6/9) manages registration, discovery, and run-time routing across:
- Plugin registry: Axis-mapped, trust-scored, live-status plugins/tools. All plugin schemas (OpenAPI, etc.) validated and approved before use.
- Task routing controller: For every simulation, axis_vector and persona context are extracted and matched to the correct plugin/model(s).
- Connector adapters: For LangChain, RAG, regulatory APIs, OpenAI/Gemini/Claude, custom microservices, etc. Each has schema normalization.
- Fallback manager: If a plugin/tool fails or is untrusted, the system reroutes to trusted in-model agent or cached response.
- Audit tracer: All external tool use, schema calls, plugin results, and containment flags are logged at `/layer6/api_audit_traces/`, `/layer9/plugin_registry_usage/`.

Containment logic ensures:
- No external call can inject PL94/95, synthetic, or trust-divergent memory without Layer 10 sign off.
- Only admin/approved roles can register plugins or execute arbitrary tool chains.
- Axis10/11 regulatory plugins must match the regulatory scope of task or claim.

**API contracts and plugin schemas** are normalized; each payload specifies role, axis vector, agent context, and retrieval/injection trace.

---

## **3. Webhook & Event Subscription Management**

A robust **event-driven gateway** (Layer 6, 9, 10) allows for:
- Secure webhook registration (endpoint, event type(s), authentication, axis_scope, content_format).
- Per-event security: HMAC or JWT signatures, axis/role-bound subscription, dead-letter queue and retry policy.
- Payloads include: event_id, event_type, axis_vector, trust_score, containment_flag, session/user context, all fully auditable.
- All event triggers, including clause evaluation, agent state/fork, containment/emergence, export completion, are delivered as JSON/YAML to registered endpoints.

All webhook payloads are logged and traced, hashed, and export masked at `/layer6/webhook_delivery_traces/`. Audit failures, emergence, or synthetic events are escalated with admin alert.

Prometheus and Grafana dashboards surface Webhook latency, delivery certainties, and incident triggers.

---

## **4. Enterprise/Client Integration Governance & Monitoring**

All API, plugin, and integration actions are subject to enterprise-grade governance, including:
- **Role-aware quota management**, dynamic SLA adjustments per Axis mapping & user type.
- **Export masking:** All data sent externally is checked and redacted for PL94/95, synthetic IDs, or clause-blocked memory except with explicit override.
- **Comprehensive audit logs** for API use, plugin schema registration, role/persona assignment, masking actions, quota breaches, and context events.
- **Anomaly detection:** Any unexpected spike in export, traffic, or agent role deviation triggers automatic tracing, Layer 10 escalation, and compliance report bundling.
- **Periodic reconciliation**: All logs and exports are cross-validated—SOC2, NIST, FedRamp style—stored in `/layer10/compliance_audit_chain/`.

---

## **5. Axis-Aware Routing & Role-Based Payload Mapping**

Every API and plugin call is axis-mapped and dispatched to roles/layers with:
- **Axis1–13 vector extraction** via NLP and semantic parsing on input.
- **Quad Persona and role simulation**: Task is routed by axis_vector to Knowledge, Sector, Regulatory, Compliance Persona, or synthetic if required.
- **Trust and memory container scoping**: Assigns task or injection candidate to correct memory/resource partition, with all actions tagged by axis_vector and originating agent.
- **Plugin role validation**: All tools and plugin requests include role context and are only executed if axis/persona matches RBAC constraints.
- **Audit and traceability**: All simulation requests, belief injections, and role routes are logged at `/layer3/axis_mapping_logs/` and `/layer2/memory_tags/`.

In case of conflict, incomplete mapping, or policy violation, the system escalates to:
- **POV engine for alternate role expansion**
- **Refinement workflow rerun**
- **Containment engine halt/log**

---

## **Key Implementation Notes**

- All endpoints, integrations, and data flows are **axis-aware**, **trust-scored**, **role-mapped**, and **containment-filtered** at all times.
- Audit logs and masking/export policies are consistent across API, plugin, Webhook, and enterprise integration scenarios for compliance and security.
- Fallback and redundancy logic ensure simulation resilience even in case of external model, plugin, or API failure.
- **Prometheus/Grafana/Elastic** observability is used for enterprise telemetry and compliance metrics export.

---

## **YAML Module Summary (for Implementation)**

You may express this entire framework in a modular YAML schema, incorporating:

- `api_security_matrix.yaml`
- `external_integration_orchestration.yaml`
- `webhook_event_subscription_system.yaml`
- `enterprise_api_compliance_monitoring.yaml`
- `axis_aware_routing.yaml`

Each module can be referenced by the simulation orchestrator, API gateway, plugin manager, and containment/role governance systems.

---

**In summary**:  
This architecture ensures that every external or API-mediated action is semantically routed, trust-scored, role-audited, and fully logged for compliance, while supporting resilient plugin/model/tool integration and observability at enterprise scale—with containment, emergence, and axis/role-mapping enforced at every step.

If you require formal modular YAML, OpenAPI schemas, sample REST and webhook structures, or code samples (FastAPI, plugin adapter, event bus), let me know!
