## Final Response

Okay, I will process the user's request in a general way. The user wants to create a FastAPI backend and a Next.js (App Router) frontend based on the provided document about building effective LLM agents. This involves outlining the structure of both applications, focusing on how the concepts from the document (workflows, agents, tools, etc.) can be implemented.  Since the user is asking for a significant amount of coding, I will provide a high-level structure, key code snippets, and explanations for both the FastAPI backend and the Next.js frontend, illustrating how they can interact.  I will also highlight areas where the principles from the document can be applied.
