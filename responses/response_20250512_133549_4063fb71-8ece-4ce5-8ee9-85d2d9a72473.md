# MAAS Project Execution Plan – From Architecture to Delivery

---

## **1. Introduction and Philosophy**

MAAS is a complex SaaS platform that tightly integrates multi-agent AI, robust full-stack engineering, enterprise-grade Azure infrastructure, SaaS billing, rigorous compliance, and advanced UI/UX. Execution is phased, modular, and security-first, ensuring each foundational layer enables and validates the next, and that the stack is extensible, testable, and sustainable.

---

## **2. HIGH-LEVEL PHASED DELIVERY STRATEGY**

The project is decomposed into the following overarching stages, underpinned by agile release/sprint cycles:

1. **Project Initialization & Process Standing Up**
2. **Cloud & Dev Infrastructure Provisioning**
3. **CI/CD & Deployment Automation**
4. **Database & Core Services Setup**
5. **Backend API Development**
6. **Middleware: Multi-Agent Orchestrator**
7. **Frontend Foundation & Authentication**
8. **Frontend Feature Page Development**
9. **Testing & QA Automation**
10. **Monitoring & Logging**
11. **Accessibility & UX Refinement**
12. **Documentation & Knowledge Handover**

Each phase enables those downstream, with the possibility for parallelization where interdependencies allow.

### Technical PM, DevOps, senior full-stack developer Specialist

Absolutely! Below is a highly detailed, sequenced, and actionable plan for executing **Subtask 1: Project Initialization & Planning** for the MAAS application build, aligned with both the comprehensive design document and federal/enterprise best practices.

---

# MAAS: Project Initialization & Planning

## 1. Set Up Version Control (Git) and Repository Structure

### a. Initialize Git and Remote Hosting

- **Select VCS**: Use Git as the version control system (industry standard, supports branching, auditing).
- **Choose Hosting Provider**: Host codebases on GitHub Enterprise (preferred for Azure/AAD integration, or Azure DevOps Repos as backup).
- **Organization Setup**: Create a dedicated GitHub Organization (e.g., `maas-org`).
- **Create Repositories**:
    - `maas-production` (monorepo, recommended for tight integration, CI/CD efficiency).
    - Alternatively consider polyrepo if organizational standards or team boundaries demand; if so:
        - `maas-frontend`
        - `maas-backend`
        - `maas-middleware`
        - `maas-infrastructure`
        - `maas-docs`
        - `maas-tests`

- **Initialize Each Repo**:
    - Add initial README.md, LICENSE, and root `.gitignore`.
    - Set default branch to `main` (or `master` if required by policy).
    - Enable required branch protections and code review enforcement.

### b. Directory and File Scaffolding (per Design Doc)

- Scaffold the repo(s) to match the structure:

```plaintext
maas-production/
├── frontend/
├── middleware/
├── backend/
├── infrastructure/
├── docs/
├── tests/
├── configs/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

- In each main folder, add a placeholder `README.md` describing its purpose and future content.

---

## 2. Define Branching & PR Conventions

- **Branching Model**: Adopt GitHub Flow or Azure DevOps' Feature Branch workflow.
    - `main`: Protected, production-ready code.
    - `develop`: (optional) Integration branch for QA/staging deployments.
    - `feature/<feature-name>`: For new features (e.g., `feature/auth-middleware`)
    - `bugfix/<short-desc>`: For fixes.
    - `hotfix/<short-desc>`: For production patches.

- **Commit Message Style**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (e.g., `feat: add contract module`, `fix: Stripe validation bug`) for clear changelogs.
- **PR/Code Review Policy**:
    - Enforce PRs for all merges to `main`.
    - Require at least 2 approvals.
    - Mandate passing CI check before merge.
    - Block direct pushes to protected branches.

- **Tagging and Releases**:
    - Use semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`).
    - Automate tagging/releases via CI/CD.

---

## 3. Set Up Project Management Infrastructure

### a. Issue Tracking & Backlog Management

- **Tool**: Use GitHub Projects (or Azure Boards if DevOps is primary).
    - Create `MAAS Roadmap` project board.
    - Default columns: Backlog, Sprint Planned, In Progress, QA/Review, Done.
    - Use labels for types (`frontend`, `backend`, `infra`, `middleware`, `design`, `docs`) and priorities (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`).

- **Initial Backlog Population**:
    - Import all functional and technical requirements as *Epics*.
    - Break down into high-level *User Stories* and *Tasks* per module (based on the design doc TOC and UI/UX notes).
    - Example Epics:
        - “Frontend: Authentication & User Management”
        - “Middleware: Multi-Agent Coordination”
        - “Infrastructure: Azure Terraform Provisioning”
        - “SaaS Billing Integration”
        - “Regulatory Search Module”
        - “Contract Management Endpoints”

- **Assign Ownership**: For each Epic/Story, set preliminary owners (leads, if staffing is already scoped).

### b. Sprint Planning Model

- **Sprint Length Recommendation**: 2-week sprints (common for SaaS/enterprise).
- **Kickoff**: Set times for daily standup, weekly planning, and demo/review cycles.

---

## 4. Documentation Infrastructure

### a. Centralized Documentation Strategy

- **Tool**: Use Markdown in the `/docs` directory, supplemented by a wiki (GitHub Wiki or Azure DevOps Wiki).
- **Initial Docs to Create**:
    - `docs/architecture-overview.md`
    - `docs/development-practices.md` (coding standards, branch strategy, testing).
    - `docs/onboarding-guide.md` (dev environment setup, repo structure explanation).
    - `docs/ci-cd.md` (pipeline previews and instructions).
    - `docs/environment-config.md` (naming conventions, secret scaffolding, env files).
    - `docs/azure-guidelines.md` (subscription/resource group conventions, Key Vault, AAD).
    - `docs/uiux-style-guide.md` (link to wireframes/design systems in Figma/XD).

- **Standardize Templates**:
    - For PRs: `.github/pull_request_template.md`
    - For Issues: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bugs, features, design changes).
    - For Epics/User Stories: Sample templates.

---

## 5. Define Team Communication Channels & Norms

- **Synchronous**:
    - **Primary Channel**: Microsoft Teams (in line with Azure enterprise stack).
        - Create channels for `#maas-general`, `#engineering`, `#frontend`, `#backend`, `#middleware`, `#infrastructure`, `#design`, `#qa`, `#devops`, `#support`.
    - **Calendaring**: Setup shared MAAS calendar (meetings, sprint ceremonies, code freezes).
- **Asynchronous**:
    - **Email**: Use dedicated group alias (e.g., maas-team@org.com).
    - **Chat**: Teams chat for quick queries, tagging for priority responses.
- **Documentation/Collaboration**:
    - **SharePoint/OneDrive** for file sharing.
    - **Figma/Adobe XD** for design collaboration, linked in `docs/uiux-style-guide.md`.

- **Escalation Paths**: Document who to contact for blockers (tech lead, PM, architect).

- **Onboarding**: Add all current/future team members into correct Teams channels and provision access to the codebase, cloud resources, project management, and documentation.

---

## 6. Security & Access Control

- **Repo Permissions**:
    - Restrict admin rights to leads.
    - Developers: Write access; QA: Read access (unless otherwise required).
    - No direct commits to protected branches.
- **Secrets Management**:
    - NEVER commit secrets; point to Azure Key Vault usage and local dev `.env` files in documentation.
- **Audit Prep**:
    - Enable branch protection, force pushes disabled.
    - Enable required status checks.
    - Audit logs for repo access.

---

## 7. Initial Staffing & Expertise Required

- **Project Manager/Scrum Master**: Drives this initialization.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up repositories, branching, CI/CD previews.
- **Lead Architect**: Validates directory, code & tooling structure.
- **Engineering Leads (Frontend/Backend/Middleware/Infra/AI)**: Input on structure and plans.
- **Design Lead**: Sets up UI/UX tools and doc links.
- **QA Lead**: Advises on testing folder structure and planning.

---

---

### Stage 3: Security & RBAC

- Use role assignments to:
    - Limit access by resource (least privilege)
    - Segment by team as per design doc
    - App registrations for AAD, assign to AKS
    - All storage/db/kv access restricted via VNet, managed ID, RBAC

- NSG configurations:
    - Only required ports
    - No public IPs unless explicitly needed (e.g., LB for ingress)

- **Compliance:**
    - Enable Azure Policy for NIST/FedRAMP or Microsoft "blueprint"
    - Apply built-in policies: Enforce HTTPS, MFA, encryption at rest, etc.

---

### Stage 4: Execution Steps

1. **Write all Terraform scripts, modular**
    - Each in their own `.tf` or module folder
    - Peer review for security, resource limits, cost

2. **Create Terraform remote state storage**
    - (Bootstrap this first! Use ARM template or CLI if not done by Terraform itself)

3. **Set up Terraform backend config locally**
    - Backed by the Azure blob created above, workspace per environment

4. **Run Terraform Plan**
    - In dev/test subscriptions, review all resource create/destroy changes
    - Output plan files for audit

5. **Run Terraform Apply**
    - Follow org’s Change Management controls for prod application
    - Log who applied and when (terraform apply logs in codebase/CI runner)

6. **Connect AKS to ACR**
    - `az aks update -n <cluster> -g <group> --attach-acr <acrName>`

7. **Seed Key Vault (optional)**
    - Add initial secrets via script or manual (Stripe keys, DB creds, etc.)

8. **Set up diagnostic settings**
    - Route resource logs to Log Analytics; confirm in Azure portal

9. **Document resource setup**
    - Summarize key outputs in `/docs/infrastructure-overview.md`

---

### Stage 5: Verification & Handover

- **Verification**
    - Portal check: All resources present (regions, tiers, endpoints as expected)
    - Security scans: Ensure no public IPs/ports except as intended
    - RBAC tests: Devs, Apps, Admins can/can’t access appropriate resources
    - Diagnostic/Monitor: Make sure logs/metrics are flowing in Log Analytics/App Insights
    - AKS test: kubeconfig works, can connect, get-nodes works
    - DB/Cache: Can connect from proper subnet, only correct users
    - Key Vault: Secrets accessible only to right principals
    - Networking: VNet peering works, NSG rules effective

- **Handover to Development Teams:**
    - Save all outputs (endpoints, connection strings) as secrets or in `.env` templates
    - Document resource names, policies, maintenance in `/docs/`

```

**Common Patterns:**
- Use variables for all resource names, SKUs, regions, and sensitive config.
- Use outputs for cross-stack dependency (e.g., AKS kubeconfig, Key Vault URI).
- Secure `terraform.tfvars`, never commit sensitive values.

---

## 4. Compliance & Best Practices

- All resources must require TLS/SSL in transit and encryption at rest.
- RBAC: Do not over-permit; audit all role assignments.
- No `allow_all` network or firewall rules.
- Soft-delete and backup enabled everywhere possible.
- Logging enabled for every Azure PaaS.
- Developer access to prod is strictly denied unless break-glass, all actions auditable.

---

## 5. Example: `aks.tf` (Scaffold)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "maas_aks" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-aks"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "system"
    node_count = var.aks_node_count
    vm_size    = var.aks_node_vm_size
    enable_auto_scaling = true
    min_count  = var.aks_min
    max_count  = var.aks_max
    vnet_subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.aks_subnet.id
  }

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  network_profile {
    network_plugin = "azure"
    network_policy = "azure"
    load_balancer_sku = "standard"
  }

  azure_active_directory_role_based_access_control {
    enabled = true
    azure_rbac_enabled = true
    managed = true
    admin_group_object_ids = [var.admin_group_id]
  }

  role_based_access_control {
    enabled = true
  }

  diagnostics_profile {
    enabled = true
    # logs to be sent to azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting
  }

  tags = var.tags
}

# Output kubeconfig securely
output "kubeconfig" {
  value     = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.maas_aks.kube_config_raw
  sensitive = true
}
```

## 6. Documentation & Handoff

- **README.md in `infrastructure/terraform/`:**
    - Environment setup, TF backend/init/apply process, resource summary, support/escalation contacts.
    - "How to rotate secrets," "How to lockdown resource for security incidents," etc.
- **Docs folder:**
    - `infrastructure-overview.md`: Which resources, which region, for what purpose.
    - `security-controls.md`: Network/identity controls, audit, incident response, resource policies.

---

## 7. Next Steps & Integration

- Provide all endpoint/secret values to backend/middleware/CI via Key Vault and output files (never in code).
- Integrate resource details into future pipeline YAMLs for CI/CD and deployment.
- Include AKS connection setup and secret injection for application startup.
- Prepare resources for cost monitoring, tagging automation, and periodic security audits.

---

# Deliverables

### DevOps, cloud engineer, build automation specialist Specialist

Absolutely! Here is a highly detailed, sequential, and actionable project execution plan for:

---

# Subtask 3: CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Automation (Azure DevOps & GitHub Actions)

**Objective:**  
Design and implement robust, secure, and auditable CI/CD workflows to build, test, dockerize, push images to Azure Container Registry (ACR), inject secrets from Azure Key Vault, and deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for all major MAAS components (frontend, middleware, backend). Integrate with the previously provisioned Azure infrastructure and ensure best practices for secrets, compliance, rollbacks, and environment promotion are enforced.

---

## 1. Required Expertise & Responsible Roles

- **DevOps Engineer(s):** Experience with Azure DevOps Pipelines and GitHub Actions, Docker, Azure AKS, Helm, Key Vault integration.
- **Cloud Security Engineer:** Azure Key Vault, RBAC, secure secret management, auditing pipelines.
- **App Developers:** To maintain component-level tests & health checks.
- **Automation Tester:** CI-integrated automated tests, coverage analysis.
- **Reviewer:** IaC and CI pipeline security & compliance, audit trail, best practices.

---

## 2. Major Components in Scope

- **Frontend (Angular)**
- **Middleware (FastAPI, multi-agent orchestrator)**
- **Backend (FastAPI, core APIs/services)**
- **Common Infrastructure:**  
  - Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - Key Vault
  - AKS cluster (deployed, secrets available via dependency)
- **Environments:**  
  - Dev, Staging, Production (with workflow/environment protections)

---

## 3. Sequenced Work Breakdown

### **Stage 1: Prerequisites/Preparation**

1. **Source Code Organization**
    - Ensure repositories follow standardized structure (see design doc)
    - Separate folders for `/frontend, /middleware, /backend, /infrastructure, /.github/workflows`

2. **Service Connections & Permissions**
    - In Azure DevOps:  
      - Create Service Connections for Azure RM (for ACR, AKS, Key Vault)
    - In GitHub:
      - Establish OIDC-based federated credentials for GitHub → Azure (least privilege; no long-lived secrets)
      - Restrict Actions runner permissions (environment protection rules)

3. **Environment Setup**
    - For each environment (`dev`, `staging`, `production`):
        - Use separate Key Vault namespaces/secrets
        - Tag Docker images appropriately
        - Restrict deployment to higher environments via manual/approval gates

4. **Secrets Prework**
    - Store all sensitive settings (DB, Redis, Stripe keys, AKF endpoints, etc.) in Azure Key Vault as per dependency results
    - NEVER in repo, pipeline variables, or in plaintext in build context

5. **Prepare Kubernetes Manifests**
    - YAML or Helm Charts for each component (Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret)
    - Parameterize environment-specific values (domains, imagePullSecrets, AKF endpoints, etc.)
    - Define readiness/liveness probes and resource limits

---

### **Stage 2: Pipeline Design & Steps (for Each App Component)**

For each of `/frontend`, `/middleware`, `/backend`:

1. **Trigger Conditions**
    - On push to `<main or develop>` (auto-deploy to dev)
    - On PR to `<release/x>` branch (run full test suite, staged deploy to staging)
    - On PR merge/tag to `main/release/x` (pending approval for prod deployment)

2. **Pipeline Stages/Jobs:**

#### **A. Build & Unit Test**

- **Code checkout**
- **Dependency install**  
    - Node/npm for Angular, pip for Python
- **Lint/format validation**
- **Run unit test suite**
- **Static code analysis (SAST)**
    - e.g., SonarCloud, Bandit, ESLint, etc. as per language
- **Artifact packaging** (.tar.gz, dist/ directory, etc.)

#### **B. Dockerize & Security Scan**

- **Docker build**  
    - Build Docker image for the app; use version/commit SHA tag
    - Multi-stage build for security and efficiency
    - Enforce non-root user in image
- **Docker image scan**  
    - Use Trivy, Microsoft Defender for Container Registries, or Snyk to check for vulnerabilities; block on criticals
- **Push to ACR**
    - Tag: `maas/<component>:<env>-<gitsha>`
    - Use service principal/OIDC permissions
    - Clean up old images as per policy

#### **C. Secrets & Config Generation**

- **Fetch runtime secrets from Key Vault**
    - Use Azure CLI/Actions built-in Key Vault fetcher
    - Output to Kubernetes secret manifest (never to disk/shared logs)
    - Validate secrets injection works (integration test)
- **Generate/parameterize Kubernetes manifests**
    - Use environment appropriate variables

#### **D. Deploy to AKS**

- **Set kubectl context (via Azure login/service connection)**
- **Apply manifests/Helm charts**
    - Rollout deployment, blue-green or canary strategies if supported
    - Reference docker image just built via tagged image from ACR
    - Inject secrets as Kubernetes secrets/env vars
- **Post-deploy health check**
    - Wait for pods ready; verify `/healthz` endpoints
    - Fail or rollback on readiness probe/timeouts

#### **E. Monitoring/Testing**

- **Integration/E2E smoke tests**
    - Curl, Cypress, Postman, pytest, etc. to verify minimal up-ness
    - Optionally, trigger more extensive post-deploy tests
- **Send summary notifications**
    - Slack, Teams, email with pass/fail, and any change links

#### **F. Environment Promotion (Manual Approval)**
- For staging→prod, require:
    - Named manual/peer approval
    - Optionally, business/test coverage/release notes

---

### **Stage 3: Pipeline Implementation**

#### **A. GitHub Actions Workflow Example**
Directory: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (split into separate files if needed)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, release/**]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop, release/**]
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  ACR_NAME: ${{ secrets.ACR_NAME }}
  AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: "maas-prod-rg"
  IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        component: [frontend, backend, middleware]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js/Python
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        if: matrix.component == 'frontend'
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        if: matrix.component != 'frontend'

      # [Install dependencies, run lint, test, build steps per subfolder...]

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/maas-${{ matrix.component }}:${IMAGE_TAG} ./${{ matrix.component }}

      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

      - name: Push to ACR
        run: |
          az acr login --name $ACR_NAME
          docker push $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/maas-${{ matrix.component }}:${IMAGE_TAG}

      - name: Security scan (Trivy)
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.15.0
        with:
          image-ref: $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/maas-${{ matrix.component }}:${IMAGE_TAG}

  deploy:
    needs: build-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'production' || 'staging' }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

      # Key Vault secrets injected into deployment envs as needed
      - name: Fetch secrets
        uses: azure/cli@v2
        with:
          inlineScript: |
            export DB_PASSWORD=$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name ${{ secrets.KEYVAULT_NAME }} --name "db-password" --query value -o tsv)
            # Create a Kubernetes secret manifest or patch existing secret

      - name: Set kubecontext
        run: |
          az aks get-credentials -g $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n ${{ secrets.AKS_NAME }} --admin

      # Helm or kubectl apply for current build's manifests
      - name: Deploy to AKS
        run: |
          helm upgrade --install maas-${{ matrix.component }} ./infra/helm/${{ matrix.component }} \
            --set image.repository=$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/maas-${{ matrix.component }} \
            --set image.tag=${IMAGE_TAG} \
            # --set secret.dbPassword=$DB_PASSWORD ... (as needed)

      # Health check, smoke/test, notify

    # For prod, require manual approval:
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://maas.prod.domain
      deployment_branch_policy:
        protected_branches: true
        required_reviewers: ['DevOpsLead', 'SecurityOfficer']
```

**Notes:**
- Matrix strategy encourages DRY builds for multiple app components.
- Use GitHub Environments for deployment restrictions, audit logs, and approvals.
- Use OIDC for authentication to Azure — removes need for storing SP credentials.
- Never echo or log secrets in steps.

#### **B. Azure DevOps Pipeline Example**  
_Details similar, using azure-pipelines.yml, with stages for build, test, dockerize, push, deploy._

---

### **Stage 4: Secrets Management & Compliance**

- All secrets referenced in pipeline and app manifests are injected at runtime via:
    - Kubernetes Secrets: Populated from Key Vault fetches
    - Environment variables: Passed via Helm/kubectl (not via codebase)
- Periodic secret rotation enforced by policy and checked in pipeline via script/manual steps.
- Add diagnostic logging to all pipeline and deployment steps; send logs/metrics to Azure Log Analytics.

---

### **Stage 5: Rollback & Failure Handling**

- On deploy failure:
    - Use Helm/kubectl to roll back to last successful release.
    - Surface errors in pipeline checks, notify team(s), auto-open Incident if prod.
- Store all pipeline outputs for every run for audit.

---

### **Stage 6: Documentation & Handover**

1. **In `/docs/ci-cd-pipelines.md`:**
    - Workflow diagrams, secret flow
    - How to run/deploy locally or for new envs
    - Checks/tests required for promotion to prod
    - Who can approve prod deploys

2. **In `/docs/deployment-strategies.md`:**
    - Blue/green/canary strategies supported (for selected envs)
    - How to roll back application images
    - Release naming/versioning/tagging standards

3. **Pipeline YAML(s) under version control**  
   - All changes are code reviewed and subject to PRs (never bypassed in prod)

---

## 4. Dependency Integration

**Relies on:**

- All Azure infra from subtask 2 being provisioned and accessible
- Key Vault fully populated with all needed secrets (DB, Stripe, AKF, SMTP, etc.)
- AKS has RBAC set up for pipelines' identities
- ACR attached to AKS

**Handover:**  
Summarize endpoints, image tags, secret locations, and deployment methods for all app teams in `/docs/`.

---

## 5. Compliance & Security Controls

- All pipelines must run in ephemeral environments (hosted runners) or controlled self-hosted ones
- Access to deployment and secrets is RBAC-protected and auditable
- All secrets injection steps never log or expose values
- Access to production deploys is gated and audited
- Image scanning (SAST/DAST) blocks on known vulnerabilities before deployment

---

## 6. Deliverables

- **CI/CD pipeline definitions (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, or `azure-pipelines.yml`) per component**
- **Helm charts/K8s manifests for all components in `/infrastructure/helm/` or similar**
- **Documentation in `/docs/ci-cd-pipelines.md` and `/docs/deployment-strategies.md`**
- **Verification checklist for every deploy (build, test, scan, secrets, health, post-deploy test, notification)**
- **Promotions/audits/incident handling workflow documented**
- **Audit logs of all pipeline/deployment runs stored for 1+ year as per compliance**

### Backend engineer (Python, SQLAlchemy), database architect Specialist

Certainly! Below is a detailed, sequenced, and actionable project plan to execute:

---

# Subtask 4: Database & Core Services Setup

**Objective:**  
Define the foundational data layer for MAAS, implementing PostgreSQL schemas, base Alembic migrations, Redis configuration, Neo4j (or vector DB) bootstrap, and robust connection logic within the backend. This enables the unified storage, caching, and knowledge graph backbone required for all business modules and AI agents, as outlined in the design and infrastructure documentation.

---

## 1. Required Skills & Team

- **Backend DB Engineer** (lead): Database modeling, migrations, performance
- **Python Backend Engineer:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, async DB patterns
- **Graph DB Specialist:** Neo4j modeling or Azure vector DB familiarity
- **DevOps/Infra** (support): Access to Key Vault, DB endpoint setup, secret mgmt
- **QA/Reviewer:** Data integrity, migration, and connection test experience
- **(Optional) Security/Compliance:** Ensure encryption/configural best practices, audit logging

---

## 2. Dependencies

- Azure infrastructure (AKS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j/Cosmos) provisioned per Subtask 2
- Secret endpoints/creds in Azure Key Vault or `.env`
- Agreed naming conventions, expected module structure per design doc

---

## 3. Work Breakdown, Sequenced

### Stage 1: Design, Planning, and Artifacts

**a) Artifact Directory Structure**
```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── db/            # connection logic, session management
│   └── alembic/
│       └── versions/
└── migrations/
    └── README.md
```

**b) Confirm/Document:**
- PostgreSQL DB endpoint, name, user, password (via Key Vault env injection)
- Redis endpoint, Redis auth (from Key Vault)
- Neo4j connection URI, user, password, SSL options
- Choose SQLAlchemy version (2.0+ strongly recommended for async)

---

### Stage 2: PostgreSQL Schema Design & Modeling

#### a) Identify Main Entities (per Design Doc)

- **User**: id, display_name, email, role(s), org, external_ids, status, created_at, federated_id (from Azure AD)
- **Organization**: id, name, type, domain, regulatory_channels, is_active, created_at
- **Ticket**: id, organization_id, submitter_id, category, priority, status, description, response, created_at, updated_at
- **Opportunity**: id, external_id, organization_id, agency, deadline, summary, metadata, imported_at
- **Solicitation**: id, opportunity_id, draft_state, author_id, doc_url, compliance_status, created_at
- **Proposal**: id, solicitation_id, submitter_id, status, agent_evaluations, ai_explanation, score, attachment_url, submitted_at
- **Contract**: id, proposal_id, award_date, value, current_status, milestones, org_id, doc_url, performance_data
- **Image/Media**: id, owner_id, context_type, context_id, blob_url, type, created_at
- **TrainingModule**: id, title, content_url, completion_criteria, metadata, active, created_at
- **Subscription**: id, user_id/org_id, tier, status, stripe_customer_id, renewal_date, plan_features
- **AuditLog**: id, actor_id, action, context, timestamp, details

#### b) Draft SQLAlchemy Models  
(Use dataclasses or declarative approach. Example for **User**)

```python
# backend/src/models/user.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean, DateTime, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, relationship
from datetime import datetime

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    display_name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)
    role = Column(String, nullable=False)
    organization_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('organizations.id'))
    status = Column(String, default="active")
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    federated_id = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)  # Azure AD Object ID
    # relationships, etc.
```

- Repeat for all entities.
- Create relationships (e.g., `organization` in User, `tickets` in Org).

#### c) Normalize Where Needed  
- Use enums for status fields (active, pending, etc.).
- Use JSONB fields for extensible metadata where required (see AKF/ref data).

---

### Stage 3: Alembic Migrations Set-Up

#### a) Alembic Installation & Config Init
- `pip install alembic`
- `alembic init src/alembic`

#### b) Configure `alembic.ini` and `src/alembic/env.py`
- Set `sqlalchemy.url` to use env variable or retrieve via Key Vault (do NOT hardcode)
- Ensure autogenerate uses the correct models metadata
```python
from src.db import engine, Base  # Base includes all models via import
target_metadata = Base.metadata
```

#### c) Generate Baseline Migration
- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"`
- Carefully review generated migration script for types, constraints, names
- Peer review: multiple eyes on migration correctness, naming, and referential actions

#### d) Migration Strategy
- Enforce ‘safe’ production practices (no destructive `drop`/rename in initial; use strict nullability)
- Focus on idempotency for multi-stage migrations

#### e) Add Migration Docs
- Guide in `migrations/README.md`: How to create, apply, roll back

---

### Stage 4: Backend Database Connection Logic

#### a) Connection Utilities in `/src/db/`

**Files:**
- `session.py`: creates engine, session, provides async generator
- `init_db.py`: for initialization tasks, seeding initial data if needed
- Adhere to FastAPI’s dependency injection for connection/session scoping

**Sample session.py (async):**
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
import os

DATABASE_URL = os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]

engine = create_async_engine(DATABASE_URL, future=True, echo=False)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(engine, expire_on_commit=False, class_=AsyncSession)

async def get_db():
    async with SessionLocal() as session:
        yield session
```

- Use `DATABASE_URL` from env secret injection (Azure Key Vault or config)
- Expose `get_db` as FastAPI dependency in controller layers

---

### Stage 5: Redis Caching Setup

#### a) Redis Client Config

- Use `redis-py` (>=4.x), async (if preferred) for FastAPI
- Config from env, e.g., `REDIS_URL`, `REDIS_PASS`
- Place init in `/src/utils/redis_client.py`
  
**Sample:**
```python
import os
import redis

REDIS_URL = os.environ["REDIS_URL"]

redis_client = redis.StrictRedis.from_url(REDIS_URL, decode_responses=True)
# Or, for async
# from redis.asyncio import Redis
# redis = Redis.from_url(REDIS_URL)
```

#### b) Usage Guidelines

- Session/cache for:
    - Authentication/session tokens (if not only in Azure AD)
    - AI agent temporary results for workflow orchestration
    - Frequently accessed regulatory lookups, AKF hot data
- Document expiration patterns, eviction policies, and cache invalidation strategies in code comments/docs

---

### Stage 6: Neo4j (or Vector DB) Bootstrapping

#### a) Choose Python Library

- For Neo4j: `neo4j` driver (recommended)
- For Cosmos/Vector: `azure-cosmos` or SDK per design choice

#### b) Connection Config

- Place in `/src/utils/neo4j_client.py`  
- Use env variables (via Key Vault injection) for location, user, password, TLS
- Example Neo4j connection:
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import os

NEO4J_URI = os.environ["NEO4J_URI"]
NEO4J_USER = os.environ["NEO4J_USER"]
NEO4J_PASS = os.environ["NEO4J_PASS"]

driver = GraphDatabase.driver(NEO4J_URI, auth=(NEO4J_USER, NEO4J_PASS), encrypted=True)
```

#### c) Base Bootstrap Script

- Create a utility (`src/utils/init_akf_graph.py`):
    - Checks if root regulatory nodes (“FAR”, “DFARS”, etc.) exist
    - Adds seed data for testing queries, relationships

**Sample:**
```python
def bootstrap_akf(driver):
    with driver.session() as session:
        session.run(
            "MERGE (reg:FAR {name:'Federal Acquisition Regulation', code:'FAR'})"
        )
        # Seed additional sample nodes/relationships
```

- Document run path: run manually after first up, then via admin job.

---

### Stage 7: Application Integration and Testing

#### a) Secrets Management

- Ensure ALL connection strings (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `NEO4J_URI`, etc.) are injected via env, with local override for dev (never in code).
- Document loading logic in `/backend/docs/secrets.md`.

#### b) Health Check Endpoints

- Implement `/health/db`, `/health/cache`, `/health/akf` endpoints in FastAPI.  
    - Each checks real connectivity (db query, Redis ping, Neo4j query)
    - Add these to the base controller set

#### c) Example Tests (Place in `/tests/backend-tests/`)

- **DB Migration Test**:  
    - Assert all tables exist post-migration, required constraints present
- **Redis Cache Test**:  
    - Write/get/delete test value
- **Neo4j/Vector DB Test**:  
    - Can connect, can create/read simple node

#### d) Sample Data (optional)
- Seed dev DB/AKF graph with minimal data for local testing

---

### Stage 8: Documentation & Handover

- Update `/backend/README.md`:
    - Setup instructions
    - Migrations: how to apply and roll back
    - How to run/test Redis and Neo4j
    - Expected env variables (reference to secret names; do not include values)
    - Troubleshooting common issues (auth, network, missing migrations)

- Document DB ERD, AKF sample graph, and cache key usage in `/docs/`

---

### Stage 9: Review/Checklist Before Proceeding

- [ ] Alembic migrations reviewed, repeatable on clean DB
- [ ] Redis config secured, not public, aligns with project eviction policy
- [ ] Neo4j/Vector DB endpoint, authentication, index setup, and compliance verified
- [ ] All connections successfully tested from backend in the deployed VNet
- [ ] Secrets and keys **never** checked in to git; always pulled from Key Vault
- [ ] Healthcheck endpoints working
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Outputs shared with appropriate module leads (for controllers, AI agent boot, etc.)

## 5. Notes and Best Practices

- Use naming conventions and schema design that anticipates growth and multi-tenancy (e.g., SHARED org_id, global vs. org-specific data)
- All persistent fields that might hold user data must be encryptable at rest/per compliance
- Use UUIDs as primary keys if privacy or global uniqueness needed (especially for public APIs)
- Redis must not be used for sensitive data unless encrypted
- Neo4j/vector data used for explainable AI and knowledge mapping—validate compliance with privacy boundaries

---

## 6. Deliverables

1. **Complete schema/model Python codebase** with models, Alembic migration files, sample/test data scripts
2. **Connection logic for DB/Redis/Neo4j**, fully parameterized and secrets-managed
3. **Migrations documentation** and troubleshooting guide
4. **Initial seed scripts** for AKF and (optionally) business/test data
5. **Testing scripts** for initial verification
6. **Healthcheck endpoints** implemented
7. **ERD and cache/model diagrams** in docs

---

---

## 4. Detailed Implementation Sequence

### STAGE 1: Base FastAPI Scaffold & Structure

**a) Entrypoint (main.py)**  
- Configure FastAPI app.
- Register routers from all controllers.
- Configure CORS (allow FE domains).
- Register global exception handlers.
- Add OpenAPI metadata, versioning, tags.
- Mount static/media endpoints as needed.

**b) API Versioning**  
- Use `/api/v1/` base path for all routes.  
- Example: `/api/v1/users/`, `/api/v1/proposals/` etc.

---

### STAGE 2: AuthN/Z Integration (Azure AD, RBAC)

**a) JWT Middleware**  
- Use [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) or [fastapi-azure-auth](https://github.com/Hennge/fastapi-azure-auth) for Azure AD JWT validation.
- Decode and verify `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all secured endpoints.
- Validate claims: tenant, audiences, exp, roles.
- Map roles to app RBAC: "Admin", "OrgManager", "User", etc.

**b) Auth Controller (`auth_controller.py`)**
- `/login/` endpoint (optional: healthcheck/test, since main flow is on FE via MSAL)
- `/me` for user claims/profile with token introspection.

**c) User Bootstrap**
- On user login, auto-provision user profile from AD claims if new.
- Use federated_id (Azure AD Object ID) as unique identifier.

**d) Role-based Dependencies**
- Use FastAPI security dependencies (`Depends(get_current_user)`, `require_roles`) per endpoint.

---

### STAGE 3: Modular API Controller/Router Development

#### (A) User Controller

- `/api/v1/users/ [GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE]` (RESTful CRUD, protected)
- `/me` for self-profile
- `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/roles` (admin only)
- Pagination, search filters, soft delete (status flag)
- Input validation: Pydantic UserCreate, UserUpdate
- Output: Pydantic UserOut, OrgOut schemas

#### (B) Proposal/Solicitation Controller

- `/api/v1/solicitations/`
  - CRUD: create draft, update, publish, attach docs (Azure Blob)
- `/api/v1/proposals/`
  - Submit, list, filter by user/solicitation, update (if status=draft), attach docs
- `/api/v1/proposals/{proposal_id}/evaluate`
  - Trigger AI agent evaluation workflow (call middleware)
- `/api/v1/opportunities/`
  - List/import opportunities (from external sources)

**Best-Practice:**  
- Ensure only authorized orgs/users can view or submit proposals for a given solicitation.
- Proposal status state machine: draft → submitted → evaluated → awarded/rejected.

#### (C) Ticket Controller

- `/api/v1/tickets/`
  - Submit new support ticket
  - List/filter by org/user/status/priority
  - Comment/update (status, response)
- RBAC: Non-admins see only their tickets; admins/support see all

#### (D) Contract Controller

- `/api/v1/contracts/`
  - List, get, create (on award), update, close-out
  - Attach docs/evidence to milestones (via Azure Blob)
  - Milestone state transitions, performance metrics

#### (E) Subscription Controller

- `/api/v1/subscriptions/`
  - CRUD (admin), read (user/org)
  - Plan lookup, renewal, cancel
  - Returns Stripe customer/plan metadata, renewal dates

#### (F) Stripe Controller

- `/api/v1/billing/hooks/stripe/webhook/`
  - Receives Stripe webhooks (subscription create/renewal, payment success/fail)
  - Secure via Stripe signing secret (validate header sig against secret from Key Vault)
- `/api/v1/billing/portal/`
  - Returns Stripe billing portal url for customer session
- `/api/v1/billing/invoices/`
  - List user/org invoices (calls Stripe API)

#### (G) Media Controller

- `/api/v1/media/upload/`
  - Receives file (image/pdf/doc/video/audio), streams to Azure Blob via SAS token or secure API
  - Validates content-type, size, virus scan (optional)
  - Returns blob url metadata and stores to Media table.
- `/api/v1/media/{media_id}/download`
  - Returns signed URL or streams from Blob

---

### STAGE 4: Service Layer Implementation

For each above controller, add a co-located service:
- Business logic: permission checks, DB/ORM calls, cache utilization, object mapping, transaction handling.
- No direct ORM or cache operations in router: keep services testable and clean.

Example (user_service.py):
```python
class UserService:
    @staticmethod
    async def get_user_by_id(user_id, session):
        user = await session.get(User, user_id)
        if not user:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
        return user
```

**Stripe Service:**  
- Wraps all calls to Stripe SDK, e.g., create customer, retrieve invoices.  
- Handles webhook event parsing and signature validation.

**Media Service:**  
- Manages Azure Blob upload, download, tagging, deletion.

---

### STAGE 5: Pydantic Schemas & Validation

- `schemas/` or as part of each controller/service
- Separate schemas for:
    - Input (UserCreate, ProposalSubmit, ContractUpdate, TicketComment)
    - Output (UserOut, ProposalOut, ContractView)
    - StripeWebhookEvent (validates incoming data)
    - Common error and pagination response formats
    - Use Pydantic's constr(), enums, regex, min/max wherever possible

---

### STAGE 6: Error Handling & Standards Compliance

- Global exception handler (HTTP 422, 400, 403, 404, 409, 500 mapping)
- Return NIST/FedRAMP-compliant error structure (trace_id, message, remediation URL)
- Log all security/auth/critical errors in Application Insights

---

### STAGE 7: Security and Compliance Controls

- Secure all endpoints with:
    - OAuth2 Bearer/JWT validation (Azure AD token)
    - RBAC gatekeeping (admin-only for role management, webhook endpoints, etc)
    - SQL injection protected by parameterization (always use SQLAlchemy ORM, never raw SQL)
    - Enforce schema-level/row-level multi-tenancy (org_id checks)
    - All incoming/outgoing data encrypted in transit (HTTPS enforced)
    - Sensitive data in responses strictly redacted

- Stripe:
    - Do not store credit card details. Only store customer/intent/invoice IDs from Stripe.
    - Webhook endpoint must verify Stripe signature header to mitigate spoofing.
- Media Upload:
    - Max file size restriction (<100MB unless otherwise specified)
    - Virus/malware scan hook (if feasible in pipeline)
    - User/org authorization on upload/fetch

---

### STAGE 8: Testing, QA, and Automation

- Write/extend automated tests in `/tests/backend-tests/`:
    - API contract tests (status, body)
    - AuthN/Z test: valid/invalid/missing Bearer, claims
    - RBAC: user/manager/admin role boundary tests
    - Negative tests: invalid POST/PUT payloads
    - Stripe: webhook signature tamper test, payment status logic
    - Media: signed URL expiry, unauthorized retrieval
- Use Pytest and HTTPX for async test client.

---

### STAGE 9: Documentation & OpenAPI Accuracy

- FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI/Swagger based on schemas, routes, and docstrings.
- Ensure every controller/route has detailed docstrings, response models, security scheme declared.
- Update `/backend/README.md` with:
    - Route-to-function mapping
    - Example curl/HTTP requests for each endpoint
    - Security model description

---

### STAGE 10: Review, Audit & Handover

- Peer/lead code review for:
    - Endpoint naming and parameter standards
    - Security holes (hardcoded secrets, missing authorization, over-permissive filters)
    - Business logic correctness (proposal lifecycles, permission flows)
- Static code analysis (bandit, mypy, etc).
- Final signoff prior to deployment.
- Coordinate with frontend/backend integration test suite.

---

## 5. Key File/Module Map

**Controllers**  
- `auth_controller.py` — Azure AD endpoints, user auto-provision, JWT/session health

---

## 6. Sample Endpoint Definitions

### Example: User Controller (user_controller.py)

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from src.models.user import User
from src.services.user_service import UserService
from src.utils.auth import get_current_user, require_roles
from src.schemas.user import UserCreate, UserOut

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/users", tags=["users"])

@router.get("/", response_model=List[UserOut])
async def list_users(current_user=Depends(require_roles(["admin"]))):
    return await UserService.list_all()

@router.get("/me", response_model=UserOut)
async def get_me(current_user=Depends(get_current_user)):
    return current_user

@router.post("/", response_model=UserOut, status_code=201)
async def create_user(user_in: UserCreate, current_user=Depends(require_roles(["admin"]))):
    return await UserService.create(user_in)

# More routes: get by id, update, delete...
```

### Example: Stripe Webhook (stripe_controller.py)

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request, Header, HTTPException
from src.services.stripe_service import StripeService

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/billing/hooks/stripe", tags=["billing"])

@router.post("/webhook/")
async def stripe_webhook(
    request: Request,
    stripe_signature: str = Header(None)
):
    payload = await request.body()
    # Verify signature inside StripeService
    try:
        event = await StripeService.verify_webhook(payload, stripe_signature)
        await StripeService.handle_event(event)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid Stripe webhook")
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

---

## 4. Implementation Sequence

### **A. Base API Setup & Security Configuration**

- **main.py**
    - Initialize FastAPI app.
    - Register all routers (`/api/v1/` base path).
    - Integrate CORS, preflight policies for frontend/middleware communication.
    - Register error/exception handlers.
    - Configure OpenAPI metadata, docstrings.
    - Load config from environment and Azure Key Vault.

- **utils/auth.py**
    - Implement Azure AD JWT Bearer validation for all endpoints.
    - Use MSAL or fastapi-azure-auth.
    - Parse `roles`, `tenant`, scope claims; expose `require_roles()` dependency.
    - Flask global RBAC error for unauthorized/invalid tokens.
    - All orchestrator endpoints require valid auth except "health" probe.

**_Deliverable:_ A secure, authenticated middleware API skeleton with modular router structure and authentication enforced per endpoint._**

---

### **B. Multi-Agent Persona Modules**

Each `agents/` module should include:

- **Input normalization** (schema validation, standardize to canonical data model)
- **External invocation logic** (REST/HTTP client or Azure Python SDK)
- **Response parsing** (map model output to standardized result format, with confidences and explanation)
- **Error/timeout handling** (retry logic, circuit breaker for dependent agent downtime)
- **Trace logging, unique request IDs** (for tracking agent workflows)

#### **1. compliance_agent.py**
- Connects to Azure AI Foundry or designated REST endpoint for ComplianceAgent persona.
- Accepts procurement docs; returns compliance analysis, cited regulations, and SHAP explainability where possible.

#### **2. evaluation_agent.py**
- Submits proposals/solicitations and reference docs for objective/subjective evaluation.
- Receives evaluation scores, justifications, and matrices (e.g., technical, price, past performance).

#### **3. market_agent.py**
- Takes opportunity/requirements; queries internal/external APIs or AKF for suppliers, price benchmarks, risk.

#### **4. cost_analysis_agent.py**
- Analyzes proposal cost breakdowns, pricing; raises outliers; returns cost realism and reasonableness assessments.

#### **5. contract_management_agent.py**
- Monitors contract milestones, deadlines, and deliverables using contract documentation and updates AKF nodes.
- Provides AI guidance for milestone management, closeout, and flagging potential performance risk.

**_Agents return results in a unified format: { agent: str, result: dict, success: bool, explanation: str, trace_id }_**

---

### **C. Orchestrator Core & Workflow Management**

**orchestrator/orchestrator.py**

- Orchestrator class manages:
    - **Workflow dispatch:** Determines which agents to invoke based on requested workflow (e.g., proposal evaluation, full lifecycle).
    - **State tracking:** Tracks which agents have completed, aggregates/merges results.
    - **Error/retry:** Agent-level error handling, fallback/re-queue on error/timeout. Respect agent circuit breakers.
    - **Traceability:** Assigns a trace/session ID to each invocation, persistent logging.
    - **Extensibility:** Add new agents by registration in config, or code-based “plug-in” agent model.
    - **Timeout/async:** Agents should be invoked concurrently (asyncio.gather); orchestrator times out on overall workflow SLA.

**orchestrator/workflows.py**

- Encapsulate orchestrations for:
    - **Proposal evaluation**: compliance → evaluation → cost → contract agents as multi-phase.
    - **Solicitation creation**: compliance + market agents.
    - **Contract award workflows:** evaluation/contract agents.
- Define agents-to-invoke-per-task, validation, fallback policies.

---

### **D. API Endpoints – Orchestrator & Integration Layer**

#### **api/evaluation_api.py**

- `/api/v1/orchestrator/evaluate_proposal/`
    - Accept: proposal_id, solicitation_id, optional context.
    - Secure (RBAC: "Evaluator", "Admin"); extract user/org from JWT.
    - Dispatch orchestrator “proposal evaluation” workflow.
    - Aggregate results from all AI agents.
    - Return: overall evaluation, per-agent results (`agent`, `score`, `status`, `explanation`), and trace/log references.
    - Optionally allow a `human_in_the_loop` mode (return intermediate results).

- `/api/v1/orchestrator/agent_status/`
    - Return real-time “health”/status and summary of each agent (uptime, last error), for monitoring UI.

#### **api/contract_api.py**

- `/api/v1/orchestrator/contract_management/`
    - For contract creation/award workflows: triggers contract_management_agent logic; returns risk and compliance checks.

#### **api/akf_api.py**

- `/api/v1/akf/semantic_search/`
    - Accept: query text, type [regulation/vendor/product/solicitation]
    - Integrate with AKF (neo4j/vector db) and enable semantic search. Return knowledge nodes, citation metadata.

- `/api/v1/akf/node/{node_id}/`
    - Return: full details about the given node (for UI semantic visualization).

#### **api/integration_api.py**

- Bridge endpoints for system-to-system flows:
    - `/api/v1/integration/opportunity_import/`
    - `/api/v1/integration/market_sync/`
    - (for future: connect to backend API to update proposal/contract workflows)

---

### **E. AKF/Vector Search Integration**

**utils/akf_client.py**
  - Neo4j/Vector DB client: handles session management, queries for regulatory mappings, vendor/product semantic relevance.
  - Implements:
    - `search(query_text: str) → List[KnowledgeNode]`
    - `get_node(node_id: str) → KnowledgeNode`
  - All connections and queries parameterized for security.

_Integrate AKF calls into compliance_agent, market_agent, and workflow routines as required._

---

### **F. Utility & Support Modules**

- **utils/azure_ai.py**: Handles authentication/session/token management for Azure AI Foundry requests. Caches tokens as needed.
- **utils/tracing.py**: All orchestrator/agent calls generate trace IDs and log to Azure Monitor (if available). Include trace IDs in all API responses.
- **utils/error_handlers.py**: Catch and standardize FastAPI/async exceptions. Ensure error format includes `trace_id`, agent/error context.

---

### **G. Security & Standards Controls**

- All endpoints require Azure AD JWT via `Authorization: Bearer <...>`, except `/healthz` and system probe endpoints.
- RBAC on workflows—ensure only authorized users/orgs can launch agent evaluation/cost/contract flows.
- Use traceable, ephemeral tokens for all AI agent/AKF API calls (no hardcoded secrets).
- Protect internal agent call timeouts, retries against brute/DoS.
- All sensitive logs emit only to Azure Monitor/Application Insights.
- Validate and sanitize all inbound JSON; do not process raw unvalidated text.

---

### **H. Testing, QA, and Automation**

- Implement unit tests for:
    - All agents: valid/invalid input, timeouts, bad agents
    - Orchestrator: single-agent flow, multi-agent fan-out, error aggregation
    - API endpoints: AuthN/Z enforcement, RBAC, payloads, expected/edge error cases
    - AKF/semantic search: query, node retrieval, invalid queries
- Include mock/fake agent responses for deterministic outcomes if Azure AI endpoints are unavailable.
- Write end-to-end system test for “full proposal evaluation” (from inbound proposal ID to multi-agent aggregation).
- Use Pytest + HTTPX for all async middleware tests.

---

### **I. OpenAPI & Documentation**

- Each API endpoint annotated with summary, expected status codes, error response model, and authorization requirements.
- Add example requests/responses for all orchestrator and agent endpoints.
- Document all expected agent result schema, trace ID usage, and orchestrator state progressions.
- Update middleware/README.md with:
    - Endpoint descriptions, parameters and security model
    - Orchestrator workflow lifecycles (e.g., “acquisition eval” → [compliance, evaluation, cost, contract])
    - Integration/deployment steps and config variables required

---

## 5. Example Implementation Stubs/Snippets

**orchestrator.py (core logic):**
```python
import asyncio
from agents import compliance_agent, evaluation_agent, market_agent, cost_analysis_agent, contract_management_agent

class Orchestrator:
    AGENT_MAP = {
        "compliance": compliance_agent.analyze,
        "evaluation": evaluation_agent.evaluate,
        "market": market_agent.research,
        "cost": cost_analysis_agent.analyze_cost,
        "contract": contract_management_agent.manage_contract,
    }
    @staticmethod
    async def run_proposal_evaluation(context, trace_id):
        tasks = [
            Orchestrator.AGENT_MAP["compliance"](context, trace_id),
            Orchestrator.AGENT_MAP["evaluation"](context, trace_id),
            Orchestrator.AGENT_MAP["cost"](context, trace_id),
        ]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        return Orchestrator.aggregate(results, trace_id=trace_id)
    
    @staticmethod
    def aggregate(results, trace_id):
        # Parse agent results, collect success/errors, build API payload
        return {
            "trace_id": trace_id,
            "results": [r if isinstance(r, dict) else {"error": str(r)} for r in results]
        }
```

**api/evaluation_api.py:**
```python
from orchestrator.orchestrator import Orchestrator
from utils.auth import get_current_user, require_roles
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, status

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/orchestrator", tags=["Orchestrator"])

@router.post("/evaluate_proposal/", summary="Run multi-agent proposal evaluation")
async def evaluate_proposal(payload: ProposalEvalInput, current_user=Depends(require_roles(["Evaluator", "Admin"]))):
    trace_id = generate_trace_id()
    results = await Orchestrator.run_proposal_evaluation(payload.dict(), trace_id)
    return results
```

**agents/compliance_agent.py:**
```python
async def analyze(context, trace_id):
    # Build request for Azure AI endpoint, include regulatory/AKF context
    ai_response = await azure_ai_client.compliance_analysis(context)
    explanation = ai_response.get("explanation", "")
    return {
        "agent": "compliance",
        "result": ai_response,
        "success": True,
        "explanation": explanation,
        "trace_id": trace_id
    }
```

## 6. Milestones & Delivery Steps

**Milestone 1:** FastAPI app skeleton, CORS, RBAC auth, health check endpoint  
**Milestone 2:** Agent modules built and able to call/test Azure AI endpoints (with mock/failover)  
**Milestone 3:** Orchestrator logic for 2 key workflows: proposal evaluation, contract management  
**Milestone 4:** AKF semantic search endpoints integrated and tested  
**Milestone 5:** Full API endpoints exposed, RBAC lock-down, OpenAPI doc complete  
**Milestone 6:** QA: All tests passing, error/trace/logging validated, review with backend and frontend for contract compliance  
**Milestone 7:** Ready for deployment to AKS/dev integration

---

## 7. Deliverables

- **Agents**: Each as a standalone, documented, testable module for main personas
- **Orchestrator**: Core workflow engine, agent invocation/aggregation, extensible
- **API**: Clean, secure, RBAC-protected endpoints for all orchestrator functions, AKF search, system integration
- **Utilities**: AuthN/Z, Azure AI/AKF client, logging/tracing
- **Complete documentation**: API contracts, workflow maps, error/trace handling, environment/config requirements
- **Full automated test suite** for all agent/orchestrator logic and APIs
- **Compliance proof**: evidence of RBAC lock, no secret leakage, OpenAPI security declared

---

## 8. Risk/Complexity Notes & Best Practices

- **Concurrent Ops**: Agent calls should be async and tolerant of partial failure; always return as much as possible, never block on a single agent.
- **Traceability**: Each agent workflow and all aggregated responses must reference a trace_id for full lifecycle debugging/audit.
- **AI Integration**: Use retriable logic and failover (mock) for cloud agent outages. Warn user of degraded mode if needed.
- **Security**: Never pass secrets/tokens via logs or response payloads. Restrict outbound calls only to allowlisted AI endpoints.
- **Resilience**: Build for idempotency; repeated calls with same trace should produce safe/consistent output.

---

## 9. Next Steps Upon Completion

- Handover orchestrator OpenAPI schema to Backend/Frontend for integration, stub testing with real business data.
- Final security, performance, and workflow audit review with compliance lead and project architect.
- Prepare deployment artifacts, variables, and pipelines for DevOps environment promotion.

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step **project execution plan** for **Subtask 7: Frontend UI Foundation (Angular, Fluent UI, MSAL)** based on the MAAS design document, UI/UX wireframe notes, and enterprise/federal best practices. This plan establishes your Angular frontend foundation for all future feature modules—ensuring accessibility, security, maintainability, and seamless Azure AD integration.

---

# Subtask 7 Execution Plan: Frontend UI Foundation (Angular, Fluent UI, MSAL)

---

## 1. Skills & Team Requirements

- **Angular Engineer(s):** Experience with Angular 15+, Angular CLI, modular architecture
- **UI/UX Specialist:** Fluent UI (React/Angular bindings), accessibility (WCAG)
- **Azure AD Auth/Security Expert:** Familiar with [MSAL Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular)
- **QA Engineer:** Tests for authentication, routing, a11y
- **DevOps/Dev Lead:** Linting/enforcement, Docker, initial CI scaffold

- Backend base URL and CORS domains defined.
- Git repo scaffolding completed (see Subtask 1).
- Environment variables structure defined for endpoints, tenant info, etc.

---

## 3. Execution Sequence

### A. Scaffold and Configure the Angular Project

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Use Angular CLI:
     ```bash
     ng new maas-frontend --style=scss --routing --strict
     ```
   - (If mono-repo, use `/frontend` as folder.)

2. **Directory Layout Conventions**  
   Mirror the design doc:
   ```
   frontend/
     src/app/
       components/    # General-purpose, stateless UI controls
       modules/       # Feature modules (auth, dashboard, ...)
       pages/         # Full-page components (login, dashboard, ...)
       services/      # API, state management, auth service
       models/        # TypeScript interfaces
       guards/        # Route guards (auth, roles)
       interceptors/  # API/interceptor logic (token attach, error handling)
       theme/         # Fluent UI, custom SASS, global theming
     assets/          # Logos, images, ...
     environments/    # env config files: environment.ts, environment.prod.ts
   ```

### B. Integrate Microsoft Fluent UI

1. **Choose Fluent UI Library**
   - [Fluent UI for Angular](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react) is primarily React, but for enterprise Angular we recommend:
     - [NgFluent](https://github.com/Microsoft/ng-fluent)
     - Or use [Fluent UI Web Component wrappers](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/tree/master/packages/web-components)
     - Or style [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) using Fluent’s design tokens for visual parity.

2. **Install & Set Up** (example for Fluent UI web components):
   ```bash
   npm install @fluentui/web-components
   ```
   - Configure global style sheets (`styles.scss`): import Fluent UI CSS.
   - Create a `theme/` directory to centralize brand colors, elevations, spacing, Fluent tokens.

3. **Test Fluent UI Usage**
   - Build a demo `Button` or `Card` using Fluent UI in a placeholder Landing or Login component for smoke test.

### C. Enterprise-Grade Accessibility & Responsiveness

1. **A11y and WCAG**
   - Use Angular’s a11y linter (`@angular-eslint/template-accessibility`).
   - Ensure all components use proper aria-* tags, focus management, and semantic markup.
   - Integrate Fluent UI’s accessibility guidance from [Microsoft docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/accessibility).

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Use CSS Flexbox/Grid, rem/em for fluid layouts.
   - Add media queries or responsive Angular directives for breakpoints.
   - Test layouts with Chrome Accessibility/Device tools.

### D. Set Up Secure Azure AD Authentication (MSAL)

1. **Install MSAL Angular Packages**
   ```bash
   npm install @azure/msal-browser @azure/msal-angular
   ```

2. **Configure MSAL Settings**
   - In `/environments/environment.ts`:
     ```typescript
     export const environment = {
       production: false,
       msal: {
         clientId: '<AAD-app-client-id>',
         authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>',
         redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/',
         postLogoutRedirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/',
         cacheLocation: 'localStorage',
         scopes: ['user.read'],
       },
       apiBase: 'https://api.maas.tld'
     };
     ```
   - Place sensitive config (clientId, authority) in environment files.

3. **Wire Up MSAL in App Module**
   - In `app.module.ts`:
     ```typescript
     import { MsalModule, MsalRedirectComponent, MsalGuard, MsalService, MSAL_INSTANCE, MsalInterceptor, MSAL_INTERCEPTOR_CONFIG, MsalInterceptorConfiguration } from '@azure/msal-angular';
     import { PublicClientApplication, InteractionType } from '@azure/msal-browser';

     export function MSALInstanceFactory() {
       return new PublicClientApplication({
         auth: {
           clientId: environment.msal.clientId,
           authority: environment.msal.authority,
           redirectUri: environment.msal.redirectUri,
         },
         cache: {
           cacheLocation: environment.msal.cacheLocation,
           storeAuthStateInCookie: isIEOrEdge(),
         },
       });
     }

     @NgModule({
       imports: [
         MsalModule.forRoot(
           MSALInstanceFactory,
           {
             interactionType: InteractionType.Redirect,
             authRequest: {
               scopes: environment.msal.scopes,
             }
           },
           {
             interactionType: InteractionType.Redirect,
             protectedResourceMap: new Map([
               [environment.apiBase + '/*', environment.msal.scopes]
             ])
           }
         ),
         // ...
       ],
       providers: [MsalGuard, MsalService],
       bootstrap: [AppComponent, MsalRedirectComponent],
     })
     export class AppModule { }
     ```

   - Add [MsalInterceptor](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular#usage) to `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS` to attach bearer tokens for protected API calls.

4. **Routing & Guarding**
   - Secure routes with `MsalGuard` (login required for protected pages).
   - In `app-routing.module.ts`:
     ```typescript
     {
       path: 'dashboard',
       canActivate: [MsalGuard],
       loadChildren: () => import('./modules/dashboard/dashboard.module').then(m => m.DashboardModule)
     }
     ```
   - Public routes (e.g., `/login`) remain open, but should redirect to dashboard if already authenticated.

5. **Implement Authentication Flows**
   - In `/pages/login`:
     - Use `MsalService.loginRedirect()` for sign-in button.
     - Handle login errors and loading state (WCAG: ARIA live regions).
   - Include sign-out, session expiry, and profile fetching (using ID token claims and/or call backend `/me` route).

### E. Layout, Routing, and State Management

1. **Basic Shell & Navigation**
   - Use a `CoreModule` providing:
     - Main shell component (`<maas-shell>`)
     - Top nav bar (command bar, as per wireframes)
     - Side nav/sections for main modules (Dashboard, Opportunities, Contracts, etc).
   - Implement `RouterOutlet` for navigation transitions.

2. **Routing**
   - Configure routes in `app-routing.module.ts`, structure as follows:
     - `/login`: Login page
     - `/dashboard`: Main platform dashboard
     - `/opportunities`: Opportunities module
     - `/proposals`: Proposal evaluations
     - `/contracts`: Contracts module
     - `/settings`: Profile, admin, integrations
   - Prepare lazy loading for modules for performance.

3. **Initial State Management**
   - For global state, set up [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) or [RxJS Subjects/Services] (for simple cases at start).
   - Configure `AuthState` to hold authenticated user, roles, profile info, MSAL tokens (if needed).

4. **Accessibility & Responsive Preview**
   - Use Angular Material a11y/cdk tools (`FocusMonitor`, `LiveAnnouncer`) as needed.
   - Automated WCAG testing (`axe-core` plugin, or with manual audits).

5. **Placeholder Pages**
   - Scaffold UI stubs for dashboard, major modules, and a “Not Authorized” page for RBAC.

### F. Linting, Testing, and Dockerization

1. **Linting & Format Enforcement**
   - Enable strict ESLint/TSLint rules for a11y, unused vars, code style.
   - Add pre-commit hooks if needed.

2. **Unit Tests Setup**
   - Ensure each component/service scaffolded comes with a basic Jasmine/Karma unit test.

3. **E2E Skeleton**
   - Set up Cypress/Protractor to test login, routing, and access restriction early.

4. **Dockerfile**
   - Add a `Dockerfile` for production builds:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:18 as build
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     RUN npm run build --prod

     FROM nginx:alpine
     COPY --from=build /app/dist/maas-frontend /usr/share/nginx/html
     EXPOSE 80
     CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
     ```

### G. CI Integration and Documentation

1. **CI Preview**
   - Initial GitHub Actions pipeline to build, lint, and test the app on push to feature branches; output build artifact for validation.
2. **README**
   - Document how to run the frontend in dev mode, environment setup, key commands (`ng serve`, build, test).

### DevOps, cloud/infrastructure monitoring specialist Specialist

Absolutely. Below is a **comprehensive, step-by-step, engineer-ready project execution plan for Subtask 14: Monitoring, Alerting, & Logging** for MAAS, covering concrete file/module changes, sequences per component, integration with Azure Monitor/Application Insights/Log Analytics, and actionable instructions for both coding and DevOps implementation.

---

# Subtask 14: Monitoring, Alerting, & Logging

**Objective:**  
Instrument the MAAS backend and middleware for robust operational insight by integrating Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics. Implement structured log aggregation, real-time health and agent/contract monitoring, and set up Azure alerts on all critical metrics per federal/NIST/enterprise practice.

---

## 1. Expertise and Responsibility

- **Cloud DevOps Engineer:** Azure Monitor, K8s diagnostics, DevOps pipeline/script automation.
- **Backend/Middleware Engineers:** Application Insights SDK integration, structured logging, tracing.
- **Security/Compliance Analyst:** Audit log retention, sensitive info redaction, access controls.
- **Operations/Support Lead:** Dashboard configuration, notification routing, incident/alert playbooks.

---

## 2. Dependencies

- CI/CD, infra, and containerization are operational (see Subtasks 2, 3).
- All FastAPI-based apps are running in AKS, with secrets available via Key Vault/env.
- Azure monitoring resources have been provisioned (via Terraform).
- RBAC on logs/metrics, and regulatory guidance on log storage/alerting are documented.

---

## 3. SYSTEMATIC, DETAILED PLAN BY COMPONENT

### **A. Backend (FastAPI core APIs)**

#### **1. Application Insights Instrumentation**

- **Required files:**  
  - `/backend/src/main.py`  
  - `/backend/src/utils/logging.py` (new module)
  - `/backend/requirements.txt` (add `opencensus-ext-azure`, `opencensus-ext-logging`)

- **Steps:**  
  1. **Install SDKs** in Dockerfile/requirements.txt:
     ```bash
     pip install opencensus-ext-azure opencensus-ext-logging
     ```
  2. **Add Application Insights configuration**:
     - Retrieve `APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` from Key Vault/env.
     - In `main.py`, set up `AzureLogHandler`.
     ```python
     from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler, AzureEventHandler
     import logging
     import os

     logger = logging.getLogger("maas-app")
     logger.addHandler(AzureLogHandler(
        connection_string=os.getenv('APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING')
     ))
     logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
     ```
  3. **Structured Logging Utility (`utils/logging.py`)**
     - Create `log_event`, `log_exception`, `log_metric`, `log_audit` functions that always add:
       - `user_id` (if available)
       - `trace_id` (per request)
       - `org_id`
       - Sensitive-data redaction
     - e.g.,
     ```python
     def log_event(event, user_id=None, org_id=None, trace_id=None, **kwargs):
         record = { "event": event, "user_id": user_id, "org_id": org_id, "trace_id": trace_id, **kwargs }
         logging.getLogger("maas-app").info(record)
     ```

  4. **Integrate log calls** into all controllers/services for:
     - Business events: proposal submitted, contract awarded, payment received, etc.
     - Security events: failed logins, admin changes.
     - API errors and exceptions:
       ```python
       from opencensus.ext.azure.log_exporter import AzureLogHandler
       try:
           # business logic
       except Exception as ex:
           logger.error({"action": "proposal_evaluate", "error": str(ex), "trace_id": trace_id})
           raise
       ```

  5. **Distributed Tracing (Optional/Advanced):**
     - Use `opencensus.ext.fastapi` middleware to capture end-to-end traces.
     - Propagate `trace_id`/`operation_id` via headers for all interapp comms.

#### **2. Health & Metrics Endpoints**

- Implement `/healthz` endpoint in `main.py`:
  - Returns DB/Redis/Blob/Agent health, Uptime, and version, logs periodic pings as custom metrics.

- Custom Application Insights metrics:
  - Proposal/contract counts, error rates, API latencies.

- Generate and push operational metrics using Application Insights client where relevant.

#### **3. K8s Diagnostic Settings (via Terraform or AKS Console)**

- Enable container insights for AKS cluster.
- Route all container stdout/stderr (`uvicorn`/`gunicorn` logs) to Log Analytics Workspace.
- Set up log retention to comply with federal retention standards (e.g., 1–3 years, as applicable).

---

### **B. Middleware (FastAPI Orchestrator)**

#### **1. Application Insights & Structured Logging**

- **Same as above:**  
  - `/middleware/main.py`, `/middleware/utils/logging.py`, `requirements.txt`.

- **Key points:**  
  - Each agent invocation (success/failure/timeout) must generate a log record, including:
    - `agent_name`
    - `workflow_type`
    - `input_id` (e.g., proposal_id)
    - `trace_id`
    - `duration_ms`
    - `success/failure`, error details.

  - Log aggregation of orchestrator-level results:
    - When a multi-agent workflow completes, log summary (per-agent result & consistency).
    - Mask sensitive data (e.g., no full proposals or PII in logs).

- **Custom Event Tracking:**  
  - `log_metric("agent_duration", value=ms, properties={...})`
  - `log_event("orchestrator_workflow", ...)` on every workflow start/finish/error.

- **Trace propagation:**  
  - Extract and set `trace_id` from inbound headers or generate anew.
  - Ensure trace ID is attached to logs, agent calls, and returned in UI payload.

#### **2. Middleware Health & Metrics**

- Endpoint `/api/v1/orchestrator/agent_status/` should:
  - Real-time query health of each agent (last success, last error, runtimes).
  - Log an event for each status poll so live dashboards show orchestrator reachability.

---

### **C. Azure-Side Integration**

#### **1. Infrastructure as Code**

- **Terraform provisioned resources:**  
  - `azurerm_application_insights`  
  - `azurerm_log_analytics_workspace`  
  - AKS Diagnostic Settings for logs and metrics shipping

- **Example Terraform snippet:**
  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "maas" {
    name                = "maas-laworkspace"
    location            = var.region
    resource_group_name = var.resource_group
    sku                 = "PerGB2018"
    retention_in_days   = 1095 # 3 years per federal
  }
  resource "azurerm_application_insights" "maas" {
    name                = "maas-appinsights"
    location            = var.region
    resource_group_name = var.resource_group
    application_type    = "web"
    workspace_id        = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.maas.id
  }
  ```

- Update all AKS components to output diagnostic logs to this workspace.

#### **2. AKS Config/Deployment**

- Application Insights connection string is injected into backend/middleware pods as env.
- For container logs:
  - Instruct developer images (`Dockerfile`) not to suppress stdout/stderr.

#### **3. Azure Monitor Alert Rules**

- Using Azure Portal, CLI, or Terraform, create alert rules (see section D below).

---

### **D. Alerting: Real-Time & Incident Integrations**

#### **1. Critical Metrics To Monitor & Alert On**

- **Backend:**
  - 5xx error rate >1% over 5 min
  - Average response time >1s for key endpoints
  - DB connection failure/error bursts
  - Auth failure bursts or excessive 401/403
  - Stripe webhook failures

- **Middleware:**
  - Agent invocation failure rate >5% per agent over 10m
  - Orchestrator workflow execution time >N sec (outlier detection)
  - Dead/slow agents (heartbeat missing)
  - Semantic search/AKF outage

#### **2. Log Analytics KQL Queries (for Alerts/Dashboards)**

- Example:  
  - **High Error Rate**  
    ```kusto
    traces
    | where severityLevel >= 3
    | where timestamp > ago(5m)
    | summarize ErrorCount = count() by operation_Name
    | where ErrorCount > 5
    ```
  - **Agent Failures**  
    ```kusto
    customEvents
    | where name == "agent_invocation"
    | where customDimensions["success"] == "false"
    | summarize count() by customDimensions["agent_name"]
    ```

#### **3. Azure Alert Actions**

- For each metric, define alerts with:
  - Severity (e.g., Sev2 for >5% multi-agent workflow error)
  - Action Group (email Teams, SMS, webhook to PagerDuty, etc.)
  - Playbook (optional): auto-open support ticket, scale AKS, notify on-call

#### **4. Real-Time Dashboards**

- In Azure Monitor, set up:
  - Real-time SLA dashboards (API latency, agent up/down).
  - Health heatmap of all agents.
  - Audit trail visualizations (admin events, billing actions).
- Pin key queries and graphs to the MAAS Azure Dashboard.

---

### **E. Access, Security, and Compliance**

- **Log Access Control**
  - Only authorized admins/support staff have access to diagnostics/logs.
  - All access is audited (Azure activity logs), with audit logs retained for >1 year.
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**
  - Do not log PII, financial details, proposal body, Stripe keys, JWTs.
- **Compliance**
  - Retention as per agency policy.
  - Regular review/export of logs for security audit.

  - Correct log entry with trace/context in Application Insights.
  - Alert fires in Azure Monitor.
  - Dashboard/graph shows events in near-real time (≤5min).
- Demo trace propagation from FE action → API call → middleware agent → backend return, visible in logs.
- Run compliance export/scripts to validate log retention and redaction standards.

  Update Angular router to support top-level and nested route structure for all new pages.  
  Apply guards for RBAC – users cannot access pages unless role authorized.

- **Services:**  
  For each domain (opportunities, contracts, negotiations, disputes, etc.), add or extend Angular service with RxJS observables for data management and UI state. Reuse synthesized auto-generated TypeScript interfaces/models from OpenAPI/Swagger.

- **State Management:**  
  Use RxJS-based services with BehaviorSubject or, if needed, NgRx/Redux pattern for cross-page shared state (widgets reflecting changes, notification cues, etc.).

- **Internationalization:**  
  Scaffold i18n (`@ngx-translate/core`) for support strings/messages in pages.

- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:**  
  - Screen reader tests, aria-labels, roving tab index for grid/table/list, command bar, form fields
  - Responsive CSS grid/flex layouts, with tests on Chrome/Edge/Firefox + mobile breakpoints

- **Testing:**  
  - Unit: Forms, chart, list, icon, card components; services (test backend error edge cases)
  - E2E: All major business flows for each page (from navigation → data interaction → submit/feedback)

- **Documentation:**  
  - For each page/component, docstrings in TypeScript, usage notes in `/docs/frontend/`.
  - Include API integration contract documentation ("what is expected from backend").

- **Demo Artifacts:**  
  - Screen/video captures of each interaction flow for QA and stakeholder review

- **Analytics:**  
  - Add custom event hooks for page navigations, form completions, error reporting, for Application Insights

---

## 5. DEPENDENCY MATRIX & SEQUENCING

**Dependencies (Blocking):**
- API endpoints for each domain (see prior column) must be stubbed/available (otherwise use HttpTestingController or mock services for development)
- Signed-off wireframes and Figma tokens for all relevant acquisition pages
- Confirmed RBAC/role claims in token (needed by router guards)
- Global theming settings (brand, accent color), or use Fluent defaults
- Auth interceptors (from Subtasks 7/8)

**Order of Execution (Suggested):**

1. Scaffold all features/pages/routes (with stubs, guards)
2. Implement services and models for each API integration area
3. Build dashboard & widgets (often most integrative)
4. Build opportunity import & solicitation discovery (forms, docs)
5. Implement solicitation draft wizard (deeper, more forms, regulatory integration)
6. Build contract evaluation & report (charts, tabs, XAI visualizations)
7. Complete contract management, negotiation, communication (list/detail, split view)
8. Dispute wizard, timeline, comments (templates/templates)
9. GSA/DoD/channel pages (special tables, mapping)
10. Final cross-page integration (state, routing, notifications)
11. Accessibility, responsive, and real-time refinement
12. End-to-end testing (flows across modules)

    - Export: Frontend generates CSV or requests PDF via backend (as appropriate).

- **Wireframe Details:**
    - KPI widget grid; filters at top; charts below; full table at bottom for drill-downs.

- **A11y & Security:**
    - All chart widgets support tab navigation and ARIA summary.
    - Filter/export actions are accessible and mask/suppress PII.

- **Testing:**
    - KPI/graph correctness, filter function, downloadable exports, permission checks.

---

### C. SUPPORTING MODULES AND COMMONS

1. **Services & Interceptors**
    - Ensure all `/billing`/`/subscriptions` API calls attach MSAL Bearer.
    - Common error handler for Stripe errors, subscription lapsed, payment declined, secure error messages only.

2. **Components & Utilities**
    - ***PlanSelectorComponent***: Card/toggle for plan choice, integrates with current status.
    - ***InvoiceTableComponent***: Reusable, paginates and formats invoice lists.
    - ***KPIWidgetComponent***: Inline card for metrics (accessible, uses live regions for updates).
    - ***ExportButtonComponent***: Used for both CSV/PDF (uses [file-saver.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver) or browser native).
    - ***SecureMaskPipe***: Angular Pipe to mask payment info.

3. **State/Cache**
    - Use in-memory caching for frequently-refreshed invoice data.
    - On Stripe status change (poll/websocket), auto-refresh dashboard.

4. **Error, Loading, and Success Feedback**
    - Fluent UI ProgressIndicator for loading.
    - Fluent callout/toast for success/failure.
    - Announce important events via aria-live.

---

### D. ACCESSIBILITY & RESPONSIVE DESIGN

1. **A11y Testing:**
    - Use axe-core, NVDA, or VoiceOver to verify flow.
    - All key buttons (e.g., “Download Invoice”, “Upgrade Plan”), links, and data tables tagged with meaningful ARIA roles.
2. **Responsiveness:**
    - Cards and widgets stack on mobile, show critical KPIs first.
    - Data tables scroll horizontally on small devices; use overflow and “See More.”
3. **Color/Contrast:**
    - Ensure all status badges and payment statuses pass AAA contrast for colorblind users.

---

### E. AUTOMATED TESTING

- **Unit Tests:**
    - For each component: action triggers, error state, ARIA roles, success response.
    - Masking/export pipes/utilities.
- **E2E Tests:**
    - Flow from plan change → Stripe portal → backend event reflected in dashboard.
    - Payment failure scenario (mock API).
    - Financial report filter + export flows.
- **Coverage Target:** 90% LOC for all new/changed code.

---

### F. DEPENDENCIES AND BLOCKERS

- **Backend Endpoints Must Exist and Conform:** `/api/subscriptions`, `/api/billing/*` – mock with Angular HttpTesting if needed.
- **Stripe Integration Must Be Secure:** Use only backend-provided Stripe session links; never import Stripe JS SDK or secret keys into frontend.
- **User/Role Claims Must Be Clear:** Only users/orgs with proper claim/access should see these pages.
- **Testing Stripe Webhooks/Status:** May require mock/test Stripe account or webhooks to simulate payment lifecycle.

---

### G. DELIVERABLES & ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. **All pages/components implemented, wireframe and style complete (per design doc).**
2. **Pages fully integrated with backend for live data.**
3. **All forms and data export secure and a11y compliant.**
4. **Demo scenario:**
    - Upgrade subscription → Stripe portal → payment success → dashboard update.
    - Download invoice as PDF.
    - Filter report for current quarter, export CSV.
5. **All code is reviewed, tested (unit, E2E), and meets coverage/standards.**
6. **Documentation and annotated screenshots delivered.**

## 5. SEQUENCED BUILD STRATEGY

1. **Scaffold all billing pages/routes, wire up RBAC guards.**
2. **Stub out components, connect Fluent UI controls per wireframe.**
3. **Integrate with backend APIs, develop services for Stripe flows, real-time updates.**
4. **Develop/export utilities and enforce a11y in all new UI.**
5. **Unit & E2E tests for critical billing flows, export, and access control.**
6. **Peer review, then handoff for Product/QA signoff.**
7. **Update documentation and collect screenshots/demos for final review.**

---

## 6. SAMPLE UI FLOW OUTLINE (WIREFRAME TO INTERACTIONS)

**Subscription Management**
- User sees current plan/status at top (card).
- "Upgrade" or "Cancel" plan buttons. "Update Payment" button opens Stripe portal link (in new tab).
- Subscription change triggers backend update; after update/poll, plan reflected in UI.
- Plan selector shows features/prices, disables current plan option.

**Billing Dashboard**
- List of all recent/future invoices with status/payout. Paid/unpaid clearly color-coded.
- "View" expands invoice details modal (including payment method, breakdown). "Download PDF" fetches from backend (safe link).
- Invoices auto-updated on new payment status via socket/poll.

**Financial Reports**
- KPIs/cards at top (e.g., "MTD Revenue", "Churn %").
- Interactive charts (ngx-charts) for drill-downs by month/plan/type.
- Filters at top; table below for invoice/user detail.
- Export buttons at top right.

## 4. **BUILD STRATEGY & TASK SEQUENCE**

### **4.1. Prerequisites & Dependencies**

- **Regression on APIs:** Confirm endpoints (see above) are contract-complete and mock/faked if needed.
- **Wireframe/Design Tokens:** Confirm Figma/Fluent tokens and color palettes finalized; design review with UI/UX.
- **RBAC Mechanisms:** Page guards set; ensure proper per-page and per-data field masking as appropriate.
- **Fluent UI Library:** Fluent UI Angular integrated, all custom overrides (data grid, modal, panel, steps, etc.) in place.
- **Graph Library:** Decide/prep D3 vs Cytoscape integration (wrap in Angular comp, document typing).
- **Test Tooling:** E2E (Cypress/Playwright), a11y audit tooling (axe-core), code quality (eslint/tslint).

---

3. Central “Is Connected” indicator (user can see if app is offline/reconnecting).
4. Security: all connections authenticated with MSAL access token.
5. Fallback to polling if WS unavailable.

**Testing:**
- Simulate connection loss, reconnect, out-of-order messages.
- E2E: real-time chat, ticket update, notification triggers across browser sessions.

---

## 4. SHARED/CROSS-CUTTING TASKS

- **Routing & Guards**: Only authenticated users can open ticketing, training; negotiation/collab pages require contract permissions.
- **Theming**: All components must use Microsoft Fluent UI tokens, color variables, responsive patterns.
- **State Management**: Use RxJS stores/services for cross-page state (chat conversations, unread counts).
- **Accessibility (A11y)**:  
  - ARIA roles/labels for all major controls  
  - Chat feeds: ARIA live region  
  - All interactive elements keyboard-navigable  
  - Forms: field validation error states, tab order  
- **Responsive Layouts**:  
  - Widgets, panels, and chat adapt to <600px width, touch-optimized.
- **Testing**:  
  - Unit: Minimum 95% coverage for forms/chat flows/service logic.  
  - E2E: Full multi-page/role scenarios, including concurrent realtime/collab.

This plan is designed to ensure high confidence in code correctness, compliance, and long-term maintainability, and supports both iterative and “shift-left” QA as the platform evolves.

---

# Subtask 13 Execution Plan: Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E)

**Objective:**  
Develop comprehensive, automated test suites for all major layers (Frontend, Middleware, Backend), including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. Mock external dependencies (AI agents, Stripe, Azure). Integrate test automation and reporting in CI/CD (Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions). Achieve traceable, high coverage and enable enterprise release confidence.

---

## 1. SCOPE & TEST TARGETS

### 1.1 Systems to Test

- **Frontend (Angular):** Components, services, state, user flows, routing, API integration, accessibility.
- **Middleware (FastAPI Orchestrator):** Agent orchestration, APIs, workflow logic, AKF/semantic search.
- **Backend (FastAPI):** Controllers/routers, services, business logic, DB access, Stripe/media/Azure blob.

### 1.2 Test Types

- **Unit Tests:** Isolate smallest logical units (functions, classes, components).
- **Integration Tests:** Test interactions across modules/layers; e.g. API + DB, agent orchestration, multi-step flows.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate real-world user flows and system interactions across the stack (UI → API → DB/AI/Stripe).

---

## 2. TEAM & REQUIRED SKILLS

- **QA/Test Automation Engineer:** Experience with Pytest, HTTPX, Karma, Jasmine, Cypress; strong API mocking/stubbing.
- **Frontend Engineer:** Angular unit test/E2E patterns, accessibility test tools (axe-core).

```

---

## 4. TEST DATA & ENVIRONMENT

- Use **test containers** for PostgreSQL/Redis/Neo4j (e.g. via docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml).
- DB is seeded with minimal, synthetic data—a sample org, user, roles, subscriptions, opportunities, contracts, regulatory nodes.
- **Mock AI agent/Stripe/Azure APIs**:
    - Middleware: Provide configurable fake endpoints returning deterministic responses for agents/AKF search.
    - Backend: Patch Stripe client or endpoint with fixtures.
    - Frontend: Use Angular HttpTestingController or Cypress route stubs for payment/session/invoice APIs.

---

## 5. FRONTEND TESTING STRATEGY

### 5.1 Unit Testing (Angular/Karma/Jasmine)

- **Components (UI):** Render correctness, input/output/event bindings, Fluent UI usage, visual state, accessibility tags.
- **Services:** API calls, observables, error handling; test with HttpTestingController; simulate backend payloads and errors.
- **Pipes/Utilities:** Masking, formatting, export logic.

**Example:**
```typescript
it('should call backend to upgrade plan and show success', fakeAsync(() => {
  spyOn(svc, 'upgrade').and.returnValue(of({ status: 'success' }));
  component.onUpgradePlan('pro');
  tick();
  expect(component.success).toBeTrue();
}));
```
- **Accessibility:** Use axe-core to lint rendered components for WCAG errors.

### 5.2 Integration/E2E (Cypress)

- **Flows:** Login with Azure AD, see subscription dashboard, upgrade plan, trigger Stripe portal, payment success/failure, view/download invoice, filter financial reports and export CSV/PDF, access denied for RBAC boundary.
- **State:** Use backend API mocks and stubs for payment/session endpoints; mask PII.
- **Accessibility:** Cypress + axe plugin to scan key pages.

**Example E2E:**
```javascript
cy.visit('/billing/dashboard')
  .get('.invoice-table').should('exist')
  .contains('Paid')
  .get('button.export-csv').click()
  .readFile('cypress/downloads/...).should('contain', 'Amount,Status')
```

---

## 6. BACKEND/MIDDLEWARE TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.1 Unit (Pytest)

- **Controllers:** Each route, allowed/request/forbidden, required claims, input validation.
- **Services:** Boundary/validation logic, error case, success/fail paths, prohibited access, no PII in error.
- **Utils:** JWT decode, blob upload, stripe signature validation.
- **Models/Schemas:** Pydantic validate inputs, enums, error case for bad data.

**Mock external APIs:**  
Use pytest’s monkeypatch, unittest.mock, or respx to stub Stripe, AKF/Neo4j, Azure endpoints.

**Example:**
```python
def test_user_get_me(monkeypatch, client):
    monkeypatch.setattr('utils.auth.get_current_user', lambda: UserStub(role="User"))
    resp = client.get('/api/v1/users/me')
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    assert "email" in resp.json()
```

### 6.2 Integration

- **API ↔ DB:** Insert, fetch, update, RBAC, soft-delete, foreign key, multi-tenancy.
- **Stripe:** Simulate invoice webhook (valid/invalid signature), check subscription state, ensure no card data stored.
- **Media:** Upload/download stubs, max-size test, unauth/success.
- **Middleware:** 
    - Orchestrator run with all agent calls (mocked to return varied results).
    - Timeout and error aggregation paths.

**Example:**
```python
def test_proposal_evaluation_orchestrator(client, mock_all_agents):
    resp = client.post('/api/v1/orchestrator/evaluate_proposal', json=PROPOSAL_PAYLOAD)
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    assert "results" in resp.json()
    assert all('agent' in r for r in resp.json()['results'])
```

### 6.3 End-to-End

- **Scenario:** Submit proposal → triggers orchestration → agents evaluated (mocks return synthetic outputs) → result saved in backend → frontend/E2E retrieves via API.
- **RBAC:** User with insufficient role denied; admin sees all.
- **Security:** No PII in logs, error messages redacted.

---

## 7. MOCKING/FAKING DEPENDENCIES

- **AI Agents (Middleware):**  
  Agent modules accept a “fake/mode flag” via env/env var/fixture; returns canned outputs or raises errors for negative test.
- **Stripe:**  
  Backend test uses stripe-mock (official tool) or respx/unittest.mock to simulate all API/webhook responses.
- **Azure Services:**  
  Media endpoints mock blob client (tempfile storage), skip virus scan step for speed.
- **AKF/Neo4j:**  
  Middleware test AKF client with SQLite/ephemeral in-memory DB or fixed data from JSON.

All mocks must be clear, deterministic, and easy to override.

---

## 8. CI/CD INTEGRATION

- **Pipeline Steps—Template:**
    - `npm run test` (Karma/Jasmine)
    - `npm run cy:run` (Cypress E2E)
    - `pytest --cov=backend/src/`
    - `pytest --cov=middleware/`
    - Collect artifacts:
        - JUnit or XML for test result upload
        - Coverage reports (.lcov, .xml)
        - Failing test logs
    - **Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions:**  
      All tests are gating; failures block merge. Key artifacts published for dashboard/review.

---

## 9. METRICS, REPORTING, & ACCEPTANCE

- **Coverage Targets:**  
    - Unit: 90%+ lines/functions in new code (critical business, security, Stripe, agent logic = 100%).
    - Integration: Key flows/scenarios across user, billing, agent evaluation, role checks.
    - E2E: All business-critical user stories; a11y checks on key pages.

---

## 4. EXECUTION PLAN (SEQUENCED STEPS)

### A. Automated Accessibility Audit

1. **Run Axe, Lighthouse, and Pa11y against every MAAS page:**
    - Login
    - Subscription/Billing pages (from Subtask 12)
    - Master Dashboard
    - Opportunity, Proposal, Contract, and all workflow pages
    - Modals, popups, chatbots, export/download dialogs

    **Capture:** Screenshots, detailed reports, violation/warning CSV per page.

2. **Flag and catalog all issues:**
    - Color contrast (AAA goal, minimum AA)
    - ARIA role or landmark misusage
    - Alt text missing/misapplied
    - Label associations for all form fields
    - Tab order/keyboard navigation issues
    - Focus indicators and skip links
    - Modal/dialog accessibility (trap focus, ARIA-modals)
    - Dynamic content announcers (`aria-live` for toasts, updates)
    - Language attributes, visual cue redundancies

### B. Manual/Device Testing

**Each major flow and component:**  
- Test with at least NVDA and VoiceOver
- Navigate full flows using keyboard only (Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Esc/Space/Arrows)
- Simulate users with vision/mobility impairments (assistive tech, screen mag, high contrast mode)
- Test mobile responsiveness and touch target sizing

**Test Cases:**
- Attempt every navigation and function without mouse
- Open/close all modals/dialogs, check focus return
- Activate every interactive element from keyboard
- Submit forms with screen reader; ensure error/success feedback is voiced

### C. User Testing Sessions

- **Recruit at least 3 users** with different accessibility needs (vision, mobility, cognitive) and 3 power users.
- **Provide scripts** for common tasks: log in, view dashboard, manage subscription, submit support ticket, navigate proposals, use chat bot.
- **Note:** Where possible, perform remote user testing with screen sharing.
- **Collect insights:** Record pain points, tasks failed, navigation confusion, a11y deficiencies from real usage.

### D. UX/Design Compliance Review

- **Compare live components against wireframe/UI specs:**
    - Spacing, sizing for touch/keyboard targets (min 44px)
    - Consistency of headings, color cues, iconography
    - Responsive/adaptive layouts (CSS Flex/Grid audit)
    - Info hierarchy, logical grouping, Figma/XD prototype alignment
- **Identify UX polish issues:** Unclear error messages, slow feedback, loading states, missing context help, misaligned branding.

### E. Remediation & Refinement

- **Log all findings into a tracked issue/ticket board** (tagged by: blocker/major/minor for accessibility and for UX).
- **Sequence fixes by severity:**
    - Blockers (e.g. keyboard trap, unreachable controls)
    - Major (contrast, missing alt, broken focus)
    - Minor (ARIA enhancements, label improvements)
- **Refactor or patch code as needed:**
    - Adjust ARIA roles, live regions, skip links, heading order
    - Correct color use, Fluent components for contrast/disabled state
    - Enhance feedback (toasts, errors, progress)
    - Review and fix all forms (labels, error handling, fieldset/legend)
    - Improve modal/dialog a11y patterns (trap focus, Esc close, ARIA-modal)
    - Fix navigation menus, ensure mobile-friendly a11y (touch, swipe)

### F. Regression/Verification Audit

- **Re-run all automated and manual checks** after major fixes.
- **Update user flows/scripts** and repeat spot-checks on high-traffic modules.
- **Document resolved/unresolved issues for sign-off.**

### User Testing Insights

Example: From a visually impaired tester

- **Positive:** All main menu items readable via NVDA, clear focus.
- **Issue:** Modal dialogs sometimes trap focus and cannot close with Esc.
    - Resolved: Switched to Fluent modal pattern, added Esc/Ctrl+W close handlers.

- **Positive:** High-contrast color scheme preference respected when set in OS.

---

## 7. CI/CD, DOCUMENTATION & ONGOING VERIFICATION

- **Integrate axe-core/Pa11y automated runs into CI**: “fail build if new critical a11y issue emerges.”
- **Update developer README**: a11y/UX design rules, “done” checklist for PR reviews.
- **Create a permanent documentation page**: “How to Verify Accessibility for MAAS—Developer and QA Edition”.

---

## **1. Introduction and Philosophy**

MAAS is a complex SaaS platform that tightly integrates multi-agent AI, robust full-stack engineering, enterprise-grade Azure infrastructure, SaaS billing, rigorous compliance, and advanced UI/UX. Execution is phased, modular, and security-first, ensuring each foundational layer enables and validates the next, and that the stack is extensible, testable, and sustainable.

---

## **2. HIGH-LEVEL PHASED DELIVERY STRATEGY**

The project is decomposed into the following overarching stages, underpinned by agile release/sprint cycles:

1. **Project Initialization & Process Standing Up**
2. **Cloud & Dev Infrastructure Provisioning**
3. **CI/CD & Deployment Automation**
4. **Database & Core Services Setup**
5. **Backend API Development**
6. **Middleware: Multi-Agent Orchestrator**
7. **Frontend Foundation & Authentication**
8. **Frontend Feature Page Development**
9. **Testing & QA Automation**
10. **Monitoring & Logging**
11. **Accessibility & UX Refinement**
12. **Documentation & Knowledge Handover**

Each phase enables those downstream, with the possibility for parallelization where interdependencies allow.

---

## **3. DETAILED EXECUTION PLAN BY PHASE**

### **Phase 1: Project Initialization & Planning**

- **Set up centralized version control system** (GitHub Organization or Azure Repos).
    - Scaffold main repo(s) for `frontend/`, `middleware/`, `backend/`, `infrastructure/`, `docs/`, `tests/`.
    - Add all initial README, LICENSE, .gitignore, and set branch protection and code review policies.
- **Establish project management infrastructure:**
    - Import epics/user stories into a tracking board (e.g., GitHub Projects), mapped by module and priority.
- **Define and enforce branch, commit, and PR conventions** (git-flow, Conventional Commits, semantic versioning).
- **Open all required communication channels:** Microsoft Teams groups, scheduled sprint ceremonies, shared calendars.
- **Document all the above in `/docs/` and ensure onboarding is clear for all contributors.

**_Dependencies for Next Steps: None_**

---

### **Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform on Azure)**

    - **Frontend**: Component/service pipes (Karma/Jasmine), E2E user journeys & accessibility (Cypress + axe)
    - **Backend/Middleware**: Pytest for unit, integration (DB, agent, Stripe, media), and E2E full business flows; all agent/Stripe/Blob endpoints can be mocked/faked.
    - **Integration**: Simulated real-world workflows traversing all layers
- **CI gates all merges on green, coverage targets >90%.**
- Test data and environments standardized across layers.

**_Dependencies: Usable endpoints and mocks/fakes in place per module_**

---

### **Phase 10: Monitoring, Alerting & Logging (Azure Monitor, App Insights)**

- Integrate **Azure Application Insights SDK** (backend/middleware) for structured, traceable logging and distributed tracing (per request/action).
- Set up **Log Analytics, dashboarding, alert rules** (critical errors, agent failures, SLA breaches, Stripe webhook misses, etc.)
- Feed all container logs to **Log Analytics workspace**, with RBAC-restricted access and compliance-level retention.
- Set up runbooks, incident playbooks, and hands-on validation of alert firing and traceability.
- All logging is **non-PII/non-secret**. Full documentation in `/docs/monitoring-alerting.md`.

**_Dependencies: Running AKS, proper resource configs/keys in env_**

---

### **Phase 11: Accessibility Audit & UX Refinement**

- Conduct **automated and manual WCAG 2.1 AA/Section 508 accessibility audits** (axe, Lighthouse, Pa11y, screen reader, keyboard-only, contrast, mobile).
- Run **user testing with included accessibility needs**, full flows, annotate pain points.
- Compare live system vs. Figma/XD wireframes for consistency in spacing, nav, info hierarchy, error states.
- Sequence, track, and fix all a11y or UX gaps; update documentation/screenshots; integrate a11y checks in CI.
- **Sign off only when all critical/major issues resolved and evidence of compliance recorded.**

**_Dependencies: Functional frontend FE/BE; live flows across stack_**

---

### **Phase 12: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer**

- Centralize **all architecture/API/design/wireframe/onboarding/runbook/UX/documents** in `/docs/`:
    - API specs (OpenAPI, example requests/responses, error models)
    - Infrastructure/deployment/runbooks, rollback plans
    - Architecture diagrams, component flows, agent system, AKF graphs
    - Wireframes, Figma/XD annotated exports, UX guides, a11y audit and fix logs
    - Recorded training, support videos, admin/dev onboarding, FAQs
    - Compliance matrices, FedRAMP/NIST mappings, audit evidence
- Make docs **searchable, updatable, versioned with codebase**, and mandate updates on all major changes.

**_Dependencies: All prior deliverables complete and documented_**

---

## **4. GOVERNANCE, DEPENDENCIES, & RISK MANAGEMENT**

- **Every module and deliverable is peer-reviewed and owner-assigned** (see grid/checklists from each subtask).
- All **environments, secrets, test data, and logs are secured and auditable** per compliance.
- **Access** is RBAC everywhere (dev, ops, prod), including documentation sharing.

# **6. MAAS DELIVERY CONCLUSION**

By following this integrated plan:

- All **business and technical requirements** from the MAAS design are covered, down to the module/file/component/test case and onboarding doc.
- Dependencies are validated across phases—**no blind dependencies/forward references** exist that risk “yak-shaving” deadlock.
- The execution structure supports **scalable, parallel agile progress**, high test confidence, and minimum technical debt.
- Security, compliance, and accessibility are **baked in** (not “bolted on”), with gating at every handoff.
- **Documentation, monitoring, and operational runbooks** ensure maintainability, audit readiness, and fast onboarding for any future engineer or administrator.

**Future enhancements (AI agent expansion, integration with external APIs, product verticals) are anticipated and easily supported by the componentized, extensible architecture and delivery model.**
