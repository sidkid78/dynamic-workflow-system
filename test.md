Progress Assessment: The initial research step has been accomplished, and relevant resources (MediaWiki Action API and RESTful API) have been identified for topic summary retrieval. However, further analysis of these resources to select the optimal endpoint and design its API call structure is needed. The coding and integration steps have not yet been started.

Completed Steps: 1 of 7

Unexpected Observations: Both MediaWiki Action API and RESTful API documentation were located, providing options for implementation. Caveats and limitations for certain functionalities were noted in additional resources (e.g., StackOverflow).

Task Complete: No

Next Step: Analyze the identified resources further to select the most appropriate endpoint for retrieving topic summaries. Prepare a design of how the API call will be structured, including necessary parameters, response handling, and addressing potential errors.


Task Understanding: The aim is to create a fully functional Wikipedia summary tool using Wikipedia's actual APIs (such as the MediaWiki Action API or Wikimedia REST API) to fetch topic summaries. This tool should replace the placeholder function, be robust to errors, provide accurate summaries, and integrate seamlessly into the AI framework.

Expected Outcome: A fully implemented and tested Wikipedia summary tool that fetches summaries reliably using a real API (not a placeholder). This tool will be integrated into the AI system and supplemented with complete documentation for ease of use and maintenance.

Plan:

Analyze the documentation for both the MediaWiki Action API and the Wikimedia REST API to identify the endpoint best suited for retrieving topic summaries. The goal is to choose the API with the clearest summary capabilities and the least complexity. (Tools: web_search)
Design the structure of the API request, including necessary parameters (e.g., topic name), handling of responses, and steps for dealing with errors such as missing pages or invalid inputs.
Implement the API in code using the selected endpoint. Write a function or module that makes the request, parses the response to extract the summary, and handles edge cases like missing summaries.
Test the implemented API functionality by querying multiple sample topics, ensuring the outputs are accurate, and confirming that edge cases are handled gracefully.
Integrate the finalized API functionality into the AI framework as a replacement for the placeholder Wikipedia summary tool. Ensure it conforms to the system's expected input-output design.
Conduct end-to-end testing within the AI framework, feeding real-world inputs to confirm the integration works as intended and addresses errors without breaking.
Produce developer/end-user documentation detailing the tool's inputs, outputs, usage examples, requirements, and troubleshooting steps.
