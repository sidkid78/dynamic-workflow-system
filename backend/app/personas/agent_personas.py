Agent Personas Module

This module defines the personality traits, roles, and characteristics for various agents
used across different workflow patterns in the application. Each workflow pattern has a set
of specialized agents with distinct personas to handle specific aspects of query processing.

The personas are organized by workflow pattern:
- prompt_chaining: Sequential processing with initial analysis, validation, and refinement
- routing: Classification-based query routing to specialized handlers
- parallel_sectioning: Breaking tasks into parallel components and aggregating results
- parallel_voting: Multiple independent perspectives with consensus building
- orchestrator_workers: Coordinated task delegation with specialized executors
- evaluator_optimizer: Iterative content generation with quality assessment and refinement
- meta: Cross-workflow agents for workflow selection and error handling

Each agent persona includes:
- role: The agent's functional title
- persona: Personality traits and characteristics
- description: Detailed explanation of the agent's purpose
- strengths: List of the agent's key capabilities
